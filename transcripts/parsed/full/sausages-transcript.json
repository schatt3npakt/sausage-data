  "1": "hey folks how you doing listen got a special treat for you today you got these big next year maybe it'll be a good treat to turn them into sausages you know McDonald's make such a wonderful product you got three different buns here you got the top you got your patty look at you get the special pickles there you got three of them it's some onions and boom just when you thought it was done another layer you got another patty and another layer of cheese that's beautiful so let's cut these up and turn them into some sausages got a little pickle spillage but that's okay it's all gonna be going into the into the grinder there that looks pretty good looks pretty good I think we could we could probably stop right there and see we'll see what it does in the grinder and today I'm gonna be using an electronic grinder I figured it'd be a whole lot faster if we just used a electric one we'll take some of the dough meat there and we'll just shove it right on in you always want to make good you want to have a nut you don't want to you don't want this thing to run dry all right let's get it started okay we appear to give the image go in there looking pretty good a lot of you might be saying hey don't shove your hand down there and that's good advice we're just going to shove it right on in [Music] [Music] that looks pretty good that looks pretty good to me right there that's got a consistency of a ground beef there you know a little bit dry uh perhaps then you might be used to for ground beef try to get it in there all in one go how do you might be saying hey what about the casing that goes around it he can't just you can't just make a log at a food and call it a sausage in it and I would agree with that I would agree with that so today we're gonna be using some natural hog casing yeah that looks pretty good we're just gonna do a plan B here just gonna give this a couple of cranks and then let this sausage start coming out and we're gonna call that one that's a good-looking sausage right there I'm gonna take that and twist it one more sausage gentleness oh that's beautiful oh yeah ain't never seen sausage like this from look and how that just comes out perfectly all right let's see if we could get one more of this oh I think I think that's all she wrote folks I think down I think we did pretty good here pretty good okay then I guess the last step is to finally cook these bad boys so gonna get this pan nice and hot just a splash of olive oil here just add just a tiny bit okay I think we're good to go here let's say let's go ahead and give it a shot all right so far so good there okay looks like 12 of them survived pretty good we got a problem over here this one done used to have burst we're not gonna okay so it looks like we got the tuna came out pretty good and then this one this one just ripped it this one's no good we're not gonna eat this split right right in half - that's not good sausage but these two look pretty good so I decided address one of them up with some mustard there you know the sauce should all be already in there but you know we'll see we'll see the difference between the two you pop-pop-pop-pop ",
  "2": "I think we're soon to see something happen this one's definitely a lot juicier hey there folks we're back by popular demand another ordinary sausage video last time we did a fast food item we did the Big Mac and I figured we'd switch it up a home meal classic spaghetti and meatballs so spaghetti and meatball sausage finish it up with some cheese there I came have enough more is less I always say okay that's looking that's looking pretty good to me and I think I take his time well we'll go ahead and put this into the grinder there go it right on in [Music] all the way things just kind of get it down in there I think what's then to see something happen definitely a lot juice here we go there's to be working just find a will go there if you go first [Applause] okay we got the ground spaghetti and meatballs in there with a marinara sauce the texturally it's it's a bit wet probably from the noodles holding all that water in and I'm sure the marinara sauce isn't helping I'm a little nervous with this one I think I think the casing is gonna burst because of all the wetness but you know but we're gonna give it a shot you know Cece what it how it turns out there okay so now we're gonna put it into the sausage maker there this is a big old lump there it goes dad that looks that looks pretty good to me it kind of looks like something that you'd eat see what it can do so far so good there I think we'll call that number one they say to make hay while the Sun shines so we're gonna keep this going okay I think these these came out looking pretty good I do have a concern with this one the end is pretty pretty wide open there I think it's gonna have the contents of it spill out and up Han is nice and hot I think I think it's time that we cook these put these up and see how they taste yeah see which one of these make it out alive well you know that they're hanging on they're hanging on in there against all odds they haven't quite exploded we definitely have some winners and losers than this one ladies and gentlemen bigger ones we're definitely not not so good for sausage making too much for us to handle okay and as you can see I dressed up one of them in marinara sauce there and also gave it a generous dusting of parmesan and you know it's just in case that the the one on the right doesn't turn out well we got we got something interesting to fall back on so let's give it a shot it definitely tastes like spaghetti and not so much getting the hint of the meatballs that that's kind of that's kind of a letdown I really expected that meatball flavor to come through but let's try this one now that's what that's what you're looking for ladies and gentlemen it's kind of like a parmesan chicken parmesan I had to give an overall rating I I would give this a 2 out of 5 sausages bop bop bop ",
  "3": "Oh oh geez oh boy okay welcome back to another episode I guess today we're gonna be cooking an entire KFC meal and turning that into sausage here we got the biscuit we've got the mashed potatoes and gravy we got the coleslaw dear and this is of course the drum or a leg if you want to call it that this I believe is a thigh and I don't I don't know what this one is the first step we got to do is remove the bones this is pretty hot pretty scalding give it a nice stare give it a go I think we're gonna give it some help over here I think I think we did pretty good actually it's a bit mushy but however I think I think it's a the right consistency as you would find in a ground meat so I actually think that the sausages won't burst on this one I think we're gonna we're gonna have some pretty decent looking sausages here nice and easy okay it looks like we got about five sausages out of this okay folks that pan will talk to me looking pretty good in there some spillage going on at this point these two seem to be doing pretty good now a little tip from the sausage makers community I received on my last video will poke a few holes in here Oh God look what happened oh oh oh there at those again all these of all boy oh that's no good so now we know if the next time don't don't poke mashed potato based sausages though with uh with a toothpick yet okay I guess we're gonna do the moment of truth here see how these sausages turned out you know folks I gotta tell you the sausage is pretty good I think we may have just invented a new menu item on the and the KFC there but yeah I think that would give this sausage uh a 5 out of 5 a 5 out of 5 sausages very tasty bop bop bop ",
  "4": "okay folks we got a real good one here a California robe we got all the ingredients right here I think this is going to be the first time anyone's ever made a sushi sushi sausage we're gonna give it our best shot and see how it turns out okay we didn't do too bad over here it looks so pretty all right for a California roll you know it's just a lot of what we're ready to turn this into a sausage [Music] so texturally we it's very wet it's a sticky ball of mass is what is what this is it just doesn't look too appetizing I'll tell you how it tastes all right so that's it that's about four and a quarter sausages that's not too bad I think our parents hot enough let's go and get this to Charlotte hey let's start a little one in there not too shabby okay we'll get a nice medium-sized man and tragically the little one was the first to go the the big ones seem to be holding on a little bit better here so I'm a little nervous to try this but you know we're gonna give it a shot anyway here we go gave it a little wasabi you know it is sushi after all folks yeah I gotta say that this should not be attempted by anyone it's just not worth it it's it's a terrible food don't make your sushi into the sausages just leave it the way it is it's fine the way it is this this is getting a zero out of five with the warning - do not try at home pop pop ",
  "5": "okay welcome back a guess was gonna do a pizza for this one but you know we've been having a lot of problems with doughy foods and our sausages causing them to burst and whatnot also I figured I go to the comment section and take some advice from the audience there we'll do a little Totino's pizza rolls so the first thing you need is a dirty pan just like with a steak if you're not using a seasoned cast iron pan that steaks not going to turn out too well put these pizza rolls if you're not using a dirty pan you're missing out on the flavor [Music] okay this is still hot off the presses and you could definitely still feel the heat I think this will make some pretty good sausage here it's not too wet don't think it'll burst because of the nature of the pizza roll itself it's not too doughy all right so we got about three and three and a half sausages out of that that's that's not bad these things they're pretty hard a lot hotter there's now the other sausages I've made let's see how it holds up in the pan the whole house smells like pizza rolls folks I gotta say these are some of the best-looking sausages that's ever been on the show so don't adjust your sets folks these aren't Teresa's these are raw pizza rolls where it touch the pan it actually crisped up pretty heavy about as hard as Tostitos where it didn't touch the pan though it's still soft you could push down on it let's see what it looks like kind of looks like a sweet potatoes all right let's give it a shot so it's it's pretty much flavorless you do get the taste of the breading a lot of the breading it has a good crunch to it much like a good sausage should you don't get too much of the sauce you don't get too much of the pepperoni there's a little bit of heat behind it now the texture is pretty good but I'm still good I'm gonna give this one one out of five bop bop bop bop ",
  "6": "welcome back I guess to another episode we got a big one today we're doing the 12-pack 12-pack Taco Bell box they are they are all are we're working on wrap these things and then we'll get to the sausages so you get you got your lettuce and your beef and your cheese what else what else you need all right so we're gonna run a little experiment here this one we're gonna put in the grinder but for these we're going to put them straight in the sausage maker and see how they turn out since most of the pieces are already ground up to begin with [Music] [Applause] I think we're gonna have some pretty good sausage meat here I mean it's essentially just ground beef with some taco shells in it okay we've got some residual sausage meat in there but I think it'll be okay I think it did a pretty good job getting most of that out of there yeah juices that were squeezed out of the top of that so there's a pretty big difference between first grinding your Taco Bell tacos and not as you can see these are a bit uglier the ones that went in whole the pieces are more defined in there whereas ground this could be really any kind of sausage it before you bite into it it looks pretty good for tacos at the end of the day it's not how they look it's how they taste ground sausage do another one just for safe measure here we are getting some spillage both in the ground meat or ground taco but we're also getting some spillage in where we didn't grind it up so it appears to not that not have too much of an effect on whether or not they'll explode or not yeah cut it open see what it looks like so it looks like that we keep Laura the taco shell as to be expected I mean it's not ground-up or anything so there it is okay so I think the the most grating ways to eat these in a tortilla uh-huh and so right now we'll try the ground sausage first not much of a crunch it does taste like a Taco Bell it's a pretty pretty mushy Taco Bell tasting sausage now let's see if there's any difference with one we threw in whole there's definitely more texture with the one we threw in whole makes it just a little bit better if I had to grade these uh it's not worth the time I give this a 1 out of 5 sausages I don't think we invented a new menu item today no but we tried so that's the most important thing we we gave it a shot it didn't work out this time but there's always next time bop bop bop ",
  "7": "[Music] what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] what the hey there folks welcome back to another one of these sorry that my voice sounds a little funny today I am getting over a cold but you know what they say time and sausages wait for no man and if you haven't guessed it already we're good we're gonna be doing a dessert sausage a very popular demand in the comment section it's a my prediction that there's no way that this is going to turn out well pork and sweets really don't go that well together and some of you may say hey hey look at the you know the design on there but you know I'm a I'm a sausage maker I'm not a cake decorator I'm actually saving this piece for later yeah probably shouldn't turn this thing on before we started but you know [Laughter] good god so the texture of this feels exclusively like frosting doesn't feel like cake at all and this actually makes me kind of nervous because when we push down on it with the press it's going to compact even more I'm hoping to just get one sausage out of this and there's a lot here at ways quite a bit ok it's time for the moment of truth here oh no oh that's a fail right there that's the first time that's happened on this show we burst while making it you know we're not we're not going to let this go to waste we're going to cut it off and throw it in and hope it doesn't happen to the next one okay we're just gonna keep going like that didn't even happen yeah you know I think this is why you don't see too many cakes sausages around so we managed to get five sausages out of a 28-ounce cake we would have had six but I ran out of casing at the very end so but you know I thought it would only be one and we got five so let's count our blessings I was gonna do low and slow on this but I think it's better just to get it really hot and out of the pan as quick as possible before these things have a chance to split so here we go a quick flash fry all I didn't like that either that was a bad idea no I don't don't flash fry dogs out I lower temperature not even sizzling okay there's some considerable shrinkage here get a little bit early shot there they're about half the size they were before they went in there but we did get it cooked still extremely jiggly it kind of feels like a custard but you know we'll see how it tastes well all right I guess it's the moment of truth time to taste this cake sausage it may be kind of boring for you guys to look at an empty plate so here's here's what was left in the pan I can't give this one rave enough reviews it kind of tastes like a funnel cake it's really delicious I'm gonna give this a four out of five and not a five out of five because of the spillage that we had once we figure out how to keep the cake inside of the sausage this is going to be for sure a 5 out of 5 bop bop [Music] ",
  "8": "well top of the morning to you folks it's st. Patrick's Day since it is I figured we do a traditional st. Patrick's meal a corned beef and cabbage that's pretty much it we also got some Guinness here to add some flavor to it boil the sausages and the Guinness give it a little something extra this one's probably the closest we've ever gone to a normal sausage here so it I'm betting this one's gonna turn out pretty good and this is actually one of the easier foods that you can make all you got to do is get the corned beef out of the packaging sometimes that's easier said than done save this little packet and dump it right on in actually going to want to put this fat side down [Music] well one of these don't hurt no reason not to finish these off hey hey everybody its mr. potato sausage mr. potato sausage piling up tequila if you know maybe maybe we don't drink tequila on the show anymore well there at all these folks and I gotta tell you this looks pretty good it looks like a corned beef hash I mean that's what it is and it still tastes like corned beef and it's got a little bit of the sweetness from the cabbage I'm still I'm still thinking this is going to be a pretty decent sausage here well this is it's a whole lot wetter inside of the other than I thought it would be so I'm getting kind of nervous I'm not really sure what went wrong here does it there's a whole lot of liquid going on all right we're gonna have to try to fix this a post sausage all right I guess this is the moment of truth we didn't have some problems making this sausage so hopefully it goes better in the pan looking pretty good folks looking pretty good that looks pretty good to me that looks like sausage this little guy I tried boiling first but as you can see most of the meat fell out of it that looks downright delicious if you if you want to ask me all right there they are folks we have the one that was beer battered and then we have the one that was we just prayed to get it out of the pan safely and we did a good job let's start with this one okay now this one in case you haven't guessed it already this is a five out of five sausage here it's got everything you need it tastes exactly like a corned beef sandwich with a little bit of cabbage in there for you and it is fantastic I can't stress that enough it totally keeps the flavor if I did have to put any criticism towards it is that maybe I shouldn't have cooked it so much in the beginning so that it wasn't so crumbly as you can see so so maybe don't cook it as long so that it makes a more solid sausage and of course the one that's beer-battered you have that you have that Guinness flavor still in there I could take it either or be about it or not this is a 5 out of 5 pop pop pop little public service announcement maybe not for this yet because we're all quarantined and whatnot but des if you are going to go out and enjoy the st. Patrick's Day festivities you know remember to drink responsibly and if you have too many you know call a cab or an uber but never drink and drive ",
  "9": "well hey there folks welcome back I guess to another thing here and as you can tell where we're doing we're doing a quarantined sausage made out of Vienna sausages and don't worry folks I know the people in the chat who want me to make a sausage out of sausage I know this one doesn't count also for the people who want me to make a sausage out of an MRE I'm trying my best here they're everywhere it's sold out so hopefully that this is a good meeting of the middle here and we'll show you well one of my favorite snacks when there's literally nothing else to eat and if you if you're not too familiar with the Vienna sausages I'll give you a quick demonstration here they're fully cooked and there they are you you can go ahead and just eat it right out of the can if you want to and it goes pretty good on a cracker you can just kind of mash it in there and there you go you got you got yourself a treat I'm not a fan of hot sauce but you could put mustard on there you could put you know whatever you want you know this this is your sausage you you you do within what's your please and you know sometimes you don't even need to dress it up you could just you could just suck them right down [Music] you don't have to put the cracker through the grinder you know it's just kind of crumbles fairly easily obviously you haven't seen the show before because everything that goes in the sausage goes into the grinder [Music] do a little texture test here make sure that we're making something that can be turned into a sausage and you know what looks like that the crackers you know that they got most of that liquid always going in there it still looks pretty much like a food folks you know yeah yeah a little hot sauce so we got that you know four sausages out of you know four cans of Vienna sausages and that's but that's really good you probably could have used a little bit more filling because he's a limp I guess you'd call them they look pretty close to the cake sausage if you remember that one so I'm gonna keep these linked and hope that that'll protect them from any spillage that we might have right the oil looks pretty hot cross our cross whatever you got across in there let's give this a shot all right you know so far they're holding up pretty good I don't hear anything spilling out oh yeah let's give it a little sausage flip so we know next time not not to do the sausage flip yeah we're not doing to coat over here folks I think I'm gonna have to take this one out early before any more spills out of it we got one sausage cooked out of it showed you know that's a success definitely a failure in this pan but we did get that one winner out of it and that's all we really need on this show so here we go we're gonna we're gonna taste this Vienna sausage sausage yeah here we go zero out of five bop bop-bop-bop so the entire thing just kind of burst on me it really keeps that cat food consistency and it is it is overly salty we just compacted all that salt into it ",
  "10": "well hey there folks welcome back I guess to another episode here and what an episode we have a lot of people have been asking this by name but a lot of people have just been saying you know if you could just do some Chinese food Arnold that'll be terrific for us alright so I figured I'd go to I go to at Panda Express here take a look at their famous orange chickens and figured we'd turn that into some sausages thank you and you know that not everybody's got a Panda Express so I figured maybe would go over the anatomy of an orange chicken and basically what you got is you got your clump of chicken here and they fry it so it's got a little bit of a hard shell on it but the longer it sits in that sauce it's gonna it's gonna get a little bit mushy ER and there you go it's just chicken coated in flour and uh there are this I think it's aptly named correctly and then of course you got your lo mein or I think they actually call it chow mein and it's this isn't actually my favorite thing on the menu I think it's kind of plain tasting but you put that together with the orange chicken and you and you've got yourself some magic baby [Music] okay so we made some pretty quick work of that it's definitely very mushy if I take it and hold it and clump it together it holds a shape you know I that's off to Panda Express this thing just went through the grinder like bottom and I tell you what they don't even pay me to say that this is this is just a free plug for Panda Express so if you're going to turn your Chinese food into a sausage look no further than Panda Express okay three two one it's sausage time you know what yeah I don't like that let's not use them in making sausages doesn't always have to be working you can also have fun there's this tube often gets stuck with the remnants of the food is not enough Laura but didn't it I push it out so what you can do is put your mouth right on up to it and I think we were on the right track keeping the sausages linked last time I think we went wrong with the sausage flip but you know yeah you gotta try things in order to learn from your mistakes so uh I'm kind of glad that we did that so let's show try keeping them linked again and not doing I'm not throwing the sausage flip so far so good I mean you could you could swear that these are bratwurst but that that's orange chicken and chow mein speaking of speaking too soon there you go I think these are pretty well cooked enough let's get the rest out before we start to you know turning into the monster from tremors over here let's take a look at how we did and there it is it's it it's not much of a looker but yeah but thank you know and it's how it tastes not how it looks so let's move on to the testing of the taste and that just sort of dawned on me that we forgot to include the fortune cookie so you know let's let's try to fix that a little a little garnish I'm excited for this one let's get skip it a taste test here it's Panda Express orange chicken and chow mein sausage so that the chow mein is what I taste the most out of this I would say it tastes about 90% like the chow mein and the other percent it tastes like a little bit of the orange chicken sauce you would never be able to tell that there's actually chicken in this thing you know I think I want to revisit this one with just the orange chicken because I think that that would be a much tastier sausage because the chow mein kind of neutralized the tang enos in the spiciness of the orange chicken and it just made it taste a little bit bland with all that chow mein in there so you know for being a sausage I'm gonna give this a 2 out of 5 but an asterisk we will be revisiting this one with just the orange chicken so there it is two out of five bop-bop-bop and no one says that you have to do it right the first time you know there's plenty of second chances when you're doing sausages so we'll keep that in mind and we'll get it right the next time ",
  "11": "if you guys haven't noticed we have a new logo for the show one of the fans of the show he contacted me after the last one and said hey I'm a graphic designer and I think I think I can make a better logo and you know it said I just wanted to just just want to do it just to help out the show and so god bless him he didn't complain once through all of the revisions that I put him through and I and I know I put him through a lot so if you want to show your appreciation to this show to this channel you can do so by visiting at tech crates ones Twitter profile and let them know how much you enjoy the new logo alright and with that we'll start the show well hey there folks and welcome back I guess to another episode here and what an episode it is you may be saying hey but this these don't look like MREs there was a little screw-up at the post office and they're working on getting that package returned but until then we can celebrate the Jewish holiday here of Passover with some classic Passover foods we have the matzo gefilte fish some horseradish here you put that with the gefilte fish Manischewitz wine and we got some matzo ball soup mix so what we're gonna do a Passover sausage you know I think it said it's important that I try what these foods taste like when they're not in sausage form so we'll give that a shot no that's not very comforting all right there's a whole lot of shimmer I thought I was not expecting all right you know looks aren't everything it's a it's a hella taste you're supposed to eat the broth give it a little bit more of that and broth um there's you know maybe with the horseradish it's it that's where that you got a nice pizza matzah here it's a very cracker like give this a taste it's very dry without a whole lot of flavor do people just eat this you know look let's look look look look let's try the matzo ball soup you know what this would actually you with a little bit more salt I think it would be perfect okay remember the Vienna sausage episode oh my god it's mr. potato sausage oh let's give this Manischewitz a shot yeah okay I think our food tour is over and I you know I think it's sad time we make her some pass over sausages here [Music] the masa is curling up quite a party [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay we didn't do it too shabby now let's say I get it a stair and try to get some of that moisture out of there all right I just realized that that we didn't put the horseradish through the grinder but you know yeah it's it's fresh ground so give me a pass on this one this is warm it sticks to your fingers pretty good this is extra sticky it kind of looks like the matzo ball mixture is maybe this is what it's made out of okay we got eight sausages out of that and you don't want my you know I don't have high hopes for these sausages making it out of the pan alive so we're going to try our tried-and-true method here of keeping those sausages linked together and then you know using the ones that survived for tasting let's hope for the best here you know you you you never know unless you try oh that's just way too many I don't think they're all gonna fit in the pan but this is probably not the way you should go about it but that's that's how we're gonna do it today say we give it a little help which the Manischewitz looks like we have the first casualties over here there's time to swell pretty good here it's good filter fish you're starting to grow on me a little baby on second thought seeing how much those matzo balls ballooned up while boiling we should have known better well it's a massacre there's no other way to say this they all burst but we do have two that we're gonna try it's gonna be this one and it's gonna be that one okay I think that we should at least dress one of these with some of that gel broth from the gefilte fish well as you know they all burst but this one's definitely the most complete that still at least has the skin on so we'll give that one a taste it tastes almost exclusively like the matzo ball I can't taste any of the could felt the fish which you know it's kind of a good thing it's a little bit of the horseradish is not too much bite let's try the one that we jellied with the gefilte fish jelly jelly broth didn't really make a difference here it's not the worst sausage I've ever had on the show but it is very plain tasting it it tastes just like like a like a white bread with a little bit of eggy a little bit oniony it's just so plain that there's really no flavor behind it so one out of five but you know we do have Easter coming up so we'll see how we could destroy that holiday bop bop bop you know there's always a filter fish sausage let's try it out one that jelly broth that's what it's all about now now you get zero zero out of five ",

  "13": "well hey there folks and welcome back to another episode here this is an episode that's very near and dear to my heart the big beef and chatter happens to be my favorite fast food meal of all time so I don't know why we didn't do this one any sooner and will be accompanied by a little a little bit of the french fries because that we knows what happens when we get too many starches in our sausages and we've got some horsey sauce and some Arby's sauce there and we'll be using that as well so it's the Army's big beef and cheddar sausage let's just take a look at what's under the hood here to start off with you got your onion roll here there's the cheese this is what makes the beef and cheddar a beef and cheddar although otherwise you're just eating you know a roast beef sandwich you know you got you got a ton of roast beef and then you have the under the underneath sauce and you know what this isn't your mom's sandwich over here this is this is a big boy sandwich so we're gonna have to cut this up in order to make it fit in the grinder here [Music] well I gotta say folks this this is looking pretty promising over here it looks good it looks like that we got a lot of the roast beef and not so much all that breading it holds a shape pretty well if I clump it together like that it forms a nice shape no III think that bursting will be reasonably low with all of that roast beef that's circulating in here you know and this isn't this isn't in in in any way an attempt for Arby's to send me free food but I will take it if they do send it so there is that I made sure hold are even children get older every night well right in three two one let's shots it yeah I think that already there's no getting around it folks these look like little tarts sausages with pieces of corn in it well all right you know the old expression a hot pan needs a sausage like a hand needs a warm glove so let's go ahead and try this in the comment section everyone wants to blame the casing for the sausages bursting in the pan Bobby and they say things like you know you could poke it with a toothpick or you know maybe try boiling the sausages first the casing isn't the problem here it's the what's going inside of the case is what the problem is I'm feeling pretty bold again let's do that sausage flip on the count of three one two three it's a first-ever sausage flew people you've seen it there first oh well they snuck up on me and these two decided to burst on me so uh the good news is we still have three sausages that made it out perfectly I mean these are perfectly cooked it looked like bratwurst they have a little bit of push to them they're not jiggly at all these are these are the real deal here I I'm excited I can't wait to try it all right you know nothing too spectacular in there all right it's time for the moment of truth here I'm very excited about this one should I try it with a little bit more that Arby's sauce if you haven't noticed I ran out of hot dog buns so that's why we're pouring all these sauces on the same one here oh what a what a plop that one is so this is a little bit disappointing it the flavors fine I mean it tastes like a big beef in shatta maybe not so much the chatter part but you do taste the roast beef however it's a textural loss here it's all just very mushy the pleasure of eating a big beef and cheddar is lost when you put it in a form like this I think what we're trying the future is just try to make the best version that we can make with the ingredients we have so maybe we won't throw the buns in anymore and maybe we won't throw the French fries in there anymore maybe we'll just use primarily the meat and try to make the best tasting sausage based off of that because I'm tired of giving away these low scores here people I want to give away the fours and 5 so this one disappointing I'm gonna give it a 2 out of 5 bop bop bop this how I've been afraid of changing ",
  "14": "[Music] well hey there folks and welcome back I guess to yet and even another special episode of the sausage video program a lot of people in the comments wanted me to help Charlie out and give him some guidance on how to improve his sausage making so we'll go over to footage and see what advice I can give them oh and by the way we still will be making sausage on this episode as well as trying one of his the KFC big bucket well that was supposed to be sausage casing but I feel like I've been stabbed they've got intestines that's what sausage casing is it's the intestine loss that's good that's good tearing technique when you're shoving the food down the chute system we need to really want it really learn you know the breading can be a cruel mistress he didn't want it bad enough this is this is looking good this is looking like what we had on our show still left with a usable amount they sell a sausage attachment look at that I've never seen this method of sausage in before about holding your first sausage is exactly like holding your new this is why we're out of keeping topic is linked on our show well we've certainly made worst-looking sausages on the program so well not a total success this this isn't a total failure either well there you have it we're going to dream infer that it's a 5 out of 5 sausage yeah you make sure you get it nice and overloaded beyond its capacity and if that's the secret that most sausages won't tell all the I like to tell you the truth it looks about the same as before a way once all right there you have it folks I think it's about time we give it a try on our show I say enough of the pleasantries ooh let's get down to some sausages I was not anticipating this odd hey Callie did we really accomplish anything by sticking this in the grinder and I I would have to say no this is so loose you know if this was my recipe I would probably crumble up some graham crackers try to thicken this up because this is gonna be a really jiggly sausage this is Charlie's recipe so we're not gonna mess with it we're gonna stick it into the casing just the way it is and who knows maybe maybe it'll be like the cake sausage and it'll be a nice surprise this is the piece that Charlie was missing why his grinder kept falling off the KitchenAid there well I actually put on [Music] you know I'm hoping that I don't get be monetized for this one [Music] calling this one sausage give it a little twist how about that yeah all right we got about four sausages out of that I say we put them in the pan and watch embarrassed here goes nothing I don't know how I did that I can't believe it folks it's a it's actually working well normally on the show this would be the point where I cut open the sausage and what you see what it looks like inside but I think we can see what it looks like on the inside so we'll just go straight to the tasting well this kind of looks like the pickle so the guy in the comments who keeps wanting pickle sausage I mean this is practically gonna be the same thing eh eh and in good game in good show prep fashion Iran I didn't buy any hotdog buns so we have this piece of bread here let's give it a taste though oh it just all kind of squirt it out the end all right we're gonna try to get one good bite out of this this is this is not a 5 out of 5 here this is this is a 0 out of 5 I think the compressed grass taste it's it's even more so now it is not good sausage making material this is the bit but it bursts on the other end you know maybe there's a better way to cook this I certainly don't want to try it again bop bop either you know the secret might be to cook it before it goes into the sausage it's getting really sticky now that's just what I said rectum ",

  "19": "well he did folks welcome back I guess to another episode and before we get to the episode first some sausage news that I've been up in employed so uh first up in sausage news we are good on Emory so not only do we have these but we also have a few that are still in the p o-- box so oh man this is all crooked now and a second hey you know is to two things certain in life one is that jontron had the better I'm not so grump in the game grumps and two is hey we all make mistakes and in the last video for the score art I accidentally credited the wrong person for the person who worked so hard on the art you know he didn't get the credit that he deserves so we are going to fix that mistake right now for this score art that was featured in the last one please visit DB film underscore Ontario so go on Twitter and say hey you know well you know thanks for you know and the third thing is you know I thought just putting stuff in the description people would read it but apparently a lot of people don't go into the description of the YouTube videos so yes to answer a very common question yes I I do finally have a patreon and you can find the link in the description or I can just tell you right now that it's patreon.com slash ordinary sausage so you know not too hard to figure out enough about the news I I know that we want it we want to get to the sausage and my local Chinese restaurant has finally opened back up so well with that I think we should just go right ahead and get to the sausages [Music] it did it made about a medium-sized snatch a sausage if I didn't tell you what this was you'd say hey what is this that the Thanksgiving episode joke again I think I have a new technique that I that I thought of while I was on the toilet and you know I think I'm worried we have the answer to our sausage bursting problem and it's a spacing issue and we're going to solve that with the the with the right now okay so I think that right the issue is spacing right we've been packing into sausage and sealing them we're not really doing ourselves any services by by doing that so I figured that we just leave a lot of space in between links and keep them open that way you know if anything starts expanding it will just spill out of you know the end so that's right that's my sausage theory you know I didn't I didn't go you know to sausage you know University like like my father you know that's a topic all of it so let's give this theory a shot okay here we go there is method to this madness and I will show you you know why this doesn't look like you know you know part of you you know this looks like oh man maybe that's only you know for one sausage alright it's better to risk it on two small ones than than than one normal-sized one so these aren't lookers but you know what we're just trying to get a sausage that you know won't burst on us here we go it's almost alien in nature well I'll tell you what folks you know these sausages they couldn't they couldn't be you know how the part they just had to come together it's a it's a real you know love story in the form of sausages Mazel Tov despite all things has turned out to be you know a pretty normal looking sausage even though we started off with you know two and it merged into one it's got a good crust on it it's not jiggly the hopes are high for this one I'm gonna eat it I'm gonna tell you how it is alright so I think first we'll take a bite and then we'll start to add in our condiments and seeing if that affects the overall score so well here we go first initial bite well the first initial bite it's it's pretty plain Jane I mean it does taste like an egg roll but because we don't have that egg roll wrapper across we don't worry we don't have that kind of crunch we do have a little bit of crunch from the skin here let's see if we can dress it up with you know some condiments because you know I you know I eat my egg rolls you know with the duck sauce in the hot mustard go overall feelings you know you know putting the duck sauce and mustard on it boosted the score for me so have we not have had any condiments this would be a 2 out of 5 but with adding the hot mustard in duck sauce it's going to elevate that to a 3 out of 5 pop pop pop you know truth be told I've been eating the heck out of the sausage stuff and you know since the start of this thing because boy do I love myself some egg rolls in it which it's just you know ashamed what we do for the love of sausage ",
  "20": "well hey there folks and welcome back yes to the show look at us we're well apparently we're at the ritz-carlton because we're doing a lobster more specifically lobster tail usually we have things that are already cooked that we turn into sausages in this time we're turning you know the bass meat into a sausage so the first thing we got to do is cook it real quick and get it out into an ice bath real quick here we go for the lobster sausage 1 2 3 Oh little height alright now we're gonna see how we did alright so yeah you can see it's still uncooked we were able to just kind of reach in there and grab the meat so we got a little bit of the other poop in here so we're just gonna we're gonna get rid of that there's a little bit of lobster you know these were they say there were three ounces each so this is 12 ounces so almost a pound of lobster meat here we'll see how it does in the case I'm a lot of ideas on how to turn this on so we're just gonna [Music] well that this is as close to snot that we've ever had on the program really repulsive to the touch I don't know if you can hear that but if someone said they wanted to see a water sausage so you know let's let's let's let's make that dream come true for them while there you go there's throat there's your water sausage [Music] okay that actually produced a whole lot more sausage innards then I thought it was going to now I'm going to space it out so that we don't get sausages that burst this what this would be a really expensive one to mess up on we'll make this one flatter you know let's take the extra step of boiling them first cuz I really I really want to make a good sausage out of these just look at this sausage let's get a close-up of this beautiful if this comes to this is gonna be one heck of a sausage that feels ready too shall we don't like it lobster sausage lobster sausage it that's what I'm worried about because I didn't give it too much room on the end so I hope when it expands it doesn't you know expand right out of the right out of the game I mean the whole house smells like a seafood restaurant and you know depending on whether you like seafood or not that could be a good or bet then get it in the pan and finish finish cooking it into pan theoretically because everything's cooked in there there shouldn't be anything to burst it's a it's a shame to be doing this but I think we got to cut it open and see what it looks like you know maybe not in the middle but certainly towards the top looks book to me that's entirely Lobster in that and now you've been toasted the buns for the occasion so let's let's give this a shot without any sort of condiments on it so without having to put any sort of condiments on here this is easily a five out of five this is a fantastic sausage if I do say so myself you know economically I don't know you know if you want to spend you know 30 bucks to make you know two sausages or there's a firmness to it it's got a great crunch you know we could put butter on this okay let's try it with that butter the butter actually takes away from the score it's just better on its own you know is it better than the KFC sausage no it is equal to the KFC sausage so lobster sausage five out of five bop bop-bop-bop and dad the shelves aren't going to be going the way he's gonna make lobster bisque with the shells but maybe we'll do that for the live stream I'm not sure you know because it does take a while to make that soup ",

  "30": "well hey there folks connect can everyone hear me there's usually like like a 15-second delay before I realize that you know that there's people that can hear me or not and so yeah I'm just gonna wait to see yes yes we can hear you before you know I move on briefly things still kosher all right I think I think you can hear me so welcome to The Accidental a public livestream this was you know supposed to be a livestream just for the patrons but you know yours truly you know set it up wrong and set it up public so welcomes everyone go thank the patrons for this wonderful livestream that we're about to do also you know we have an hour to get through you know only two MREs but you know I don't think it's gonna take us that long but you know don't worry we got a ton of these MREs laying around because I forgot to say hey we're good on MREs too late so now the house is filled with MREs and you know whoa I forgot whose MREs these were but what you know will credit them you know when we do a highlight video because obviously not everyone's gonna see this uh well I say you know we get started with everyone's favorite well know you tell me audience you tell me do you want that the chicken chunks white cooked or the red shape to barbecue flavored pork patties oh I'm so it obviously the rebbe is it's all red all I'm seeing is ribs so you know you know with a title like chicken chunks white cooked I don't see how that Lots but here we are and yeah I got a little I got a little opening up the box this was in you know I kind of stabbed the MRE but I don't it didn't pierce the underneath so give that a rip down the center and this is what we got here well this is it this is the rib shaped barbecue pork patty in all of its glory look how thin you see what else we got here we've got the banana nut Ranger bar tff I love the tff you know you people don't put enough tff and in there stuff more toilet paper Bart oh the barbecue sauce okay okay that's good and oh and by the way apparently everyone else in their mom knew that this this opens lengthwise because it's supposed to be like a bowl because you don't have you know a plate but but no one else wanted to check the comments so there's like a million comments of people telling me the same thing of oh yeah it's because you don't have a plate out there you're supposed to use the dang that the package itself is your bowl and plate what's this apple jelly wonderful you know that's going in there creamer well this is this is a zero calorie sweetener I thought I thought calories were important so why would you make it zero calorie wouldn't you want to put calories into the thing because you're trying to put as much calories into the soldiers what the heck is this now ooh freeze-dried coffee and I you know if you're not getting yourself iodized you know who are you buddy you know get get your act together you got to get those ayodhya iodization 'z Enya and a moist towelette and when you're done you know just two pieces of gum dad there's a million things in here there's the long spoon there's the long spoon now correct me if I'm wrong but this spoon totally goes all the way down it so what's the I'm bringing this back up because you're supposed to do it lengthwise for the bowl but look this this easily reaches just this way it's so easy to do it this way instead of this way all right we got what the heck is this this is this is the breaded wheat snack that everyone's told me to hey watch out there's there's a poisonous packet in there that's gonna kill you as soon as you eat it so you know don't eat that so yes I will be aware not to put the poisonous the poisonous moisture-wicking also there's still more stuff tropical punch flavored there's no fruit juice in this in this juice that's the first time I've seen 0% juice usually it's like 5% well I don't think that's going in there I'm gonna drink this because I'm you know I'm already thirsty and there's the activator what is this now what you got to do math in the field ok well I got a cup I don't need to I don't need to mess with this bag so that's good well it's uh see the ingredients were going to use this was the SantaFe rice and beans Oh they'd even say that this was included you get santa fe rice and beans with the herbs with your beef patty yeah you like that chin yeah you can you can watch that chin all day long buddy all right ok let's open up these let's see how ribs shape they really are well that's you know disappointing oh hey mrs. sausage hey come look at this now when you see when you when you hear the phrase rib shaped rib shaped does that come to your it does look like a McRib it does but we're gonna we're gonna mix it with the rice and we're gonna mix it you know with the beans oh you know what I just realized I didn't heat this up do we really need to heat it up though it is precooked yeah well we'll heat up the the Magnificent rice and beans but boy if I could just tell you the smell that's going it is you can hear mrs. sausage gagging in the background all right I did forget to heat it up though that what that's a rookie mistake but you know you basically it's already it's already cooked so you yeah well like we're gonna we're gonna use these Santa Fe rice and beans and clean it all up there we go we did tear it in all right and it says to fill it with you know you know a sizable amount of water where's the overfill line well I'm pretty sure that that just went straight over the overfill line but we're gonna where's my where's my hot pocket sleeve this is are you heating up in there I don't think that this is heating up you better heat up when I tell you to heat up do we have a question from the audience okay it's heating up now I feel the heat God look at that just that rib sausage or it will be rib sauce is that rib that rib shaped pork patty is really just the star of the show all right they stay I think that's going to heat up at some point but they say you know not to do this inside because this the fumes are a little bit toxic so I'm supposed to shake it Oh how often do they want me to shake this all right Chuck I just you know and and you know they tossed its shots pretty good but in case that there was any where's now what did I do with the sauce there's more of that there's more of that sauce where it came from in this packet well I say well that's heating up well you know we don't really have much time to wait we gather that we got to get going here so go get the bowl out [Music] and it just it crumbles just the way you thought a rib should again that cutting it lengthwise makes total sense because you want to eat it like it's out of a bowl right people Oh the barbecue sauce isn't that bad well that's about as much of the rib meat that you got it kind of looks awful that sawdust that no one convinced me that that is not sawdust [Music] all right how long is this supposed to take the cook it feels it doesn't feel hot it feels warm it feels warm and I don't see any of that wonderful scheme that I saw in the last one you're soaked yourself why don't you eat enough get in there look that's a really matter if it's hot or not I mean if this thing starts heating up on its own I'm gonna be super super angry well this makes no sense to open it sideways well there's your brace and beans I mean that's why we're putting it through the grinder but why you know I made one comment that we put everything in the grinder and now you can't even make a water sausage without putting it in the grinder first where's Mike here we go turn this back on [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well what else what else I mean I feel like I've been transported to to Santa Fe New Mexico with with that with that rice see what we got here these are the hot pockets the pizza hot pockets you know I'm not going to put this in there because all it will do is just make it first it adds no flavor whatsoever so we know that from the last MRE what is it banana nut Ranger bar that definitely looks like a banana nut Ranger bar oh boy is that spicy what a mess what a mess all this is out there goes to spoon yeah all right give it you know we'll give it a little stir by the way that rib meat in case in case you're late that red meat is sawdust you know who's ever manufacturing the the rib meat boy are they having a laugh at the government's expense because that is sawdust there's no actual meat in there well I guess we should you know put it in the stuffer the moist towelette we're not putting the moist towelette in there you want all right let's have a vote who wants the apple jelly it takes about 15 seconds all right we have a no we have a yes we have a yes we have oh it's even oh no it's all right dude oh boy all right the guesses have it yeah we girl oh it's just so gelatinous you know think that open from the side you know otherwise you know how tearing it the other way that spoon would never have fit in there how would this have possibly have worked no only this way apparently oh you want me to turn on donate donations and I yeah so this was an accidental livestream public live stream so that setting isn't turned on this this was supposed to just be for patrons but I accidentally made it public so I owe my patrons another live stream one that is in public but yeah if you want to contribute you know buy a shirt or you know think about becoming a patron and then see you know live streams that you were supposed to be private but turned out to be public anyway so you know that could be that could be you right now everyone's favorite part of course is dealing with the intestines and you know they're like headphones that you know you would throw in your backpack and that they get tangled very easily the longer they are so you know a good amount of time is spent just trying to sort sort this mess out all right look we got some of that we got some of that rib oil still yeah we got we got this Darvish going on we cut to the stuffers not exactly at the same level as the board here get this a little wet give it a little grease why do you always have to make me look like a fool in front of people can't you just go on like a normal by the way this is cut out of every video me me messing with trying to get this in fact the entire live stream could probably just be me trying to get this done for an entire hour where are you [Music] good let them let them see my feet ah get up good god what a pain in the pain and uh you know I'm not sure if this is gonna stay up full or if I'm gonna make it a high light thing so I'm probably just not gonna swear you know I don't want to get demonetised again for almost saying the F word not saying it by the way not even I thought I found a loophole in a YouTube's you know thing there and they said you're not allowed to swear in the first 30 seconds on your video and you're not allowed to bleep out any swearing in the first second of your video or the first 30 seconds of your video otherwise you'll get demonetised well you know I'm not even gonna repeat it although it has been more than 30 seconds alright so what we're going to do now is not tie this off yet because we still need to we still need to get the air out of here so now it's right at the tube so now we can tie it off and not having to worry about this filling up with all that air and any questions from the audience I have mrs. sausage reading off questions so why oh I don't need this on anymore because there's no you know gases or whatever what's my day job this is my day job oh yeah I forgot that this wasn't you know so all of that made one sausage and I am not kidding oh you could get your sausage tasting either online but I get my sausage casing from the local butcher my butcher makes sausages in-house and so many butchers do and I said hey buddy can I get some of that sweet sausage casing that you're important and he said yeah so it came in a you know a plastic bucket and I took everything out and I put them in individual plastic bags am i speaking too fast oh the comments are just don't you so we're gonna give this tons of room because we are gonna let this expand like nobody's business all right note to self watch wash the kitchen shears when we're done with this I've been making sausages for I want to say ten years but it's probably closer to seven is that about seven or eight years I've been making sausages mostly normal so there haven't been any crazy lobster sausages or what happened supposedly it's just been you know trying to get back at the big big grocery for stealing all my sausage money there's two baby sausages I call oh well now we can't use that joke anymore not light a current current detentions do I not have a clean pan oh nothing like starting the live stream with the dirty pan missus sausage entertaining the folks who always wash the pan hey mister sausage do you have the time 12:27 we got it we got to get going because we have an entire under mr enoch are ya sure yes sir we're gonna try to get two of these - what he's done okay and another question for the audience do we poke holes or do we not poke holes no holes no hold that no I'm seeing I'm seeing more nose I'm seeing more nose than I am seeing no all right all right we're sticking with no on this one we'll compare all right I'm thinking you people just want to see a sausage versus butt is what I'm thinking all right that the count is in and we will not be poking any how many people are on right now oh my gosh well this was a very large turnout you know usually there's it's like 14 people because it's supposed to be just for the patrons but hey you know what it what a turnout what a turnout for an accidental public livestream what I just had the oil oh there it is no we had a standard we we got married in Vegas mrs. sausage and I oh wow that is way too much oil well there's gonna be a fire god no that's way too much that's you know safety first is is you know always what mr. sausage says safety first pumpkin and candy corn sausage for her for Halloween I want to make a blood sausage I think that would be appropriate I think everyone wants know how that mrs. sausage does but I think the blood sausage would be pretty pretty darn tasty you know in America we don't really appreciate blood sausages like the rest of the world does and it's a shame because it's a very it's a very good way to utilize all that blood alright these this home now oh sure why not here we go come with me and you'll see a world of pure imagination and things that we do involve saw suffocation Oh could you guys see my moustache did I reveal it on the livestream I may be I ain't got in the shot uh yeah so I've been growing this bad boy ever since the start of quarantine so that's been you know how many how many months now three or four months so I've been growing a mustache since then I revealed my face entirely oh well the jig is up the jig is up everyone oh yeah I know I did that but I meant did I do it on the livestream did I just go full on face here's my face everyone oh now I haven't okay well now that I want to do air sausage that seems like a fun one but you know there are you know microscopic holes in the sausage that will you know it eventually leaked out so it I don't think it would be possible to do an air sausage oh we got the side of my face well that's enough to it to make an identification she hates it misses sausage hates the mustache as well she should it's in it's in it's very itchy and and then it's I'm you know I've never really had a mustache at this length before I've kind of had like you know the the teenagers mustache that you know all boys do when they're around 17 years old but you know ever since then I never really come oh all the Santa Fe Rice all that Santa Fe Rice goodness oh no oh gosh now the oil splattering oh oh god that does not look appetizing oh I know what I'm a bad woman you don't think I've ever scooped out sausage enters into a hot dog bun before oh my god there's more than 5,000 people watching this what it work keep losing that spoon that's okay everyone loves the sound of metal on metal oh I forgot I left the stove on well rats well we we should have known that was gonna happen I was led astray by the don't poke holes in the sausage people so you can't blame that one entirely on me let's uh let's give this a shot see what it tastes like hmm it's really good um it kind of tastes like this you want to try it Oh Mitch the sausages didn't try it I'm like a 4 or 5 what do you think mrs. sausage Oh mrs. sauce is gonna eat it that's how good it is that's how you know I'm not lying she's gonna finish this it's really good it's really good it's a 4 or 5 habit of made it it's a the the red meat is well I mean it's sawdust but it's flavored like Park so it blends it tastes it's scientifically it's scientifically created to taste good so I don't know why we're surprised about this but it's uh it's uh you know we didn't get it in the casing but the inners itself mixed together they're surprisingly good it tastes it makes a really nice delicious treat all right so I think we have less than half an hour to do the other one so we better get cracking on this this is going right in the garbage and yes I will take requests for music if you guys need me to sing something you know just tell me what it is we can do more Wonka Wonka song I've been trying to get my kids to watch the 1971 version and they want I think they're coming around I think they're coming around at first they didn't know what to think how are you West Virginia fly me to the moon in West Virginia fly me to the moon I want to go to West Virginia Mountain Mama these are all good these are all these are all in my range let it go oh yeah the kids love that one how does that go but uh well I know it goes let it go let it go but there's like more to it than that esposito these are all good I so uh let's see and uh and and after all you're my Wonderwall I said maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me and you know take on me down at it at that oh there's the chicken look you look how beautiful these chunks are you can see the grid pattern that we're gonna be enjoying these these chicken chunks in all these the osmotics grant the current laws mutter cranberries are making a comeback these are good plain tortillas all right this is good these are really good first strike energy bar yeah apple cinnamon flavor that that seems fun that that seems like a fun one okay it's like Christmas in here M&Ms one full cheese spread with jalapenos now I believe if I recall watching MRE Steve that this is like this is like gold this is this is like very valuable for trading and what-have-you this is like one of the best tasting things if I'm remembering right this could this could be crap this is the the fruit punch from last time and the chicken and the beverage base lemonade that's sounds that sounds pretty good Oh buffalo style hot sauce and this is the this is just a gigantic bag of fruit beverage powder Oh add salt to the heater to make it work oh is it Jake Sloan thanks for the suggestion we'll add salt where that what I do with it did I just toss it willy-nilly what I do with it did this not come with the eater no that's the sleeve all right everyone in the livestream did you watch me just like Chuck the heater or maybe it doesn't get one maybe you'll eat a cold well this one's this oh there's no heater with this one well I guess that guess doesn't come with all well that's a rip all right let's say you know what I'm not gonna open this I'm not gonna open it lengthwise I'm gonna I'm gonna be a rebel that I am and cut it the way I think it should be oh this one you don't cut thankfully see this one they figure it out all right I'm not there's no eater to add salt to so we could just end that oh Jesus Christ all the chicken juice just spilled right out ah listen I think you can see that I'm not I'm not a man of combat oh there they are there's those chicken chunks and you say this is cooked good god that didn't that look cooked the things we do for the things we do for sausage all right who they putting this metal bowl back on a heater this this looks disgusting this this is it smells so bad [Music] oh there's more juice [Music] Oh [Music] it's spell all right osmotic cranberries do your stuff oh god it's true it's dripping in chicken juice [Music] and we need our energy so in chess I can't open it I mean my hands are just covered in chicken juice ah oh it's like a power bar yeah that's what it is [Music] [Music] right oh you want the M&Ms in there why not oh that was a terrible suggestion whoever wanted the M&Ms in there [Music] that just looked like we don't know what that looks like and here's I'm not gonna put all the tortillas in there because we don't want to oh the cheese spread I forgot about the cheese burger yeah [Music] all right and so we got that the cheese spread with jalapenos I don't think that's gonna go into the grinder because then we're gonna lose well lose most of the cheese spread in the grinder so come in and cut me a break with this one all that chocolatey jalapeno e goodness oh there's also um there's a buffalo style uh-huh hot sauce should that go in there too you tell me I'm gonna get this open because I know what the answer is yes I just saw one yes that's all I needed to see there you go what not to use to tie it off oh it's just a simple you do a loop it's it stays together with just one tie there's no special tie oh my god it stinks so bad it is entirely that she spread smell that fake cheese smell spread and I see little pieces of Eminem's can everyone see that there we go god it stinks no I'm not putting the fruit drink stuff in there because I'm thirsty and I do want to drink that after the after the live stream oh also I put this look I put this on top of the still hot a range of it what's just called stovetop no I didn't it didn't mouth even after being on top of the stovetop so that's really good alright it's get the are we getting a good shot of this here we can change the angle is everyone having a good time is everyone saying you know I'm glad ice but you know an hour watching this guy make some really ridiculous sausages God that that jalapeno cheese spread is just dominating dominating the census cleanup is going to be the worst it did Peter Griffin sing countryroads is that why everyone wants me to sing countryroads look it's kind of left it on here a little bit too long that doesn't want to budge keep going yeah all right so uh how's it go country roads take me home to the place I belong West Virginia Mountain momma take me home country roads I hear her voice in the mornin Mountain she calls me the radio reminds me of my home far away driving down the road I get a feeling like I should've been home yesterday yesterday country roads although it burst there we go no harm done that's what happens when you're too busy singing and not paying attention to the sausage well this made quite a bit more sausage than the other one in fact you know we should have put more casing on baby sharp well I think that this one's gonna be a bit of a problem just a second as we clean the pan out so crunchy so crunchy [Music] [Music] [Music] baby baby sausage come on kitchen what's this water and now we just wait for that pan to heat up and I don't know I can't get this thing off here all right where's my poker all right so we will poke we will poke the one that's closed off oh now this is poke did you can't poke that anymore this one we will leave on poke but with an open end oh yeah that's that's a lot of oil just put them in there I actually don't know the only part of that song I know is that the chorus I plus the rangedown gonna take some time to do the things we never had what Papa and Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Bombay red take my - hi - AG you that's just right outside my vocal range they wanted you to sing la Bamba oh well the one we didn't poke just burst so where my scissors my trusty Sydney they are just you know I'm thinking that these MREs they're not prime sausage you know making material all right we're gonna get this one out before he got a chance too all right okay this is the chocolate chicken the chocolate chicken Christ what else is in there apple cinnamon first-strike nutrition you got to M&Ms are in there I know there's a piece of tortilla in there too all right here we go we're gonna give this a shot it's so bad I had to spit it out that's a zero out of five people oh oh man not a good one to go out on well I think but I think what I think we learned a lot today um here here's some more of these this little these little guys uh we learned that combining chocolate and and jalapeno cheese spread is not a good combination with your your white chicken chunks and your apple cinnamon flavored nutrition energy bar that's what we learned today all right there's you know we still got we still got you know four minutes of the live stream left so you know I guess I'll keep singing and answering questions if you see any mister sausage Katy Perry I kissed a firework I didn't like that one I know I didn't yeah I'm not even gonna try a second bite that's how terrible that was that was a real shock to the system of how bad it tasted so like a total pig iron on his head that one yeah now unfortunately that's the only part of the song I know he's just big iron here's the rest of it let me see that James a Killer Queen Hey look at that it's a laser beam Hey everybody knows Queen summertime right here we can

  "31": "well hey there folks connect can everyone hear me there's usually like like a 15-second delay before I realize that you know that there's people that can hear me or not and so yeah I'm just gonna wait to see yes yes we can hear you before you know I move on briefly things still kosher all right I think I think you can hear me so welcome to The Accidental a public livestream this was you know supposed to be a livestream just for the patrons but you know yours truly you know set it up wrong and set it up public so welcomes everyone go thank the patrons for this wonderful livestream that we're about to do also you know we have an hour to get through you know only two MREs but you know I don't think it's gonna take us that long but you know don't worry we got a ton of these MREs laying around because I forgot to say hey we're good on MREs too late so now the house is filled with MREs and you know whoa I forgot whose MREs these were but what you know will credit them you know when we do a highlight video because obviously not everyone's gonna see this uh well I say you know we get started with everyone's favorite well know you tell me audience you tell me do you want that the chicken chunks white cooked or the red shape to barbecue flavored pork patties oh I'm so it obviously the rebbe is it's all red all I'm seeing is ribs so you know you know with a title like chicken chunks white cooked I don't see how that Lots but here we are and yeah I got a little I got a little opening up the box this was in you know I kind of stabbed the MRE but I don't it didn't pierce the underneath so give that a rip down the center and this is what we got here well this is it this is the rib shaped barbecue pork patty in all of its glory look how thin you see what else we got here we've got the banana nut Ranger bar tff I love the tff you know you people don't put enough tff and in there stuff more toilet paper Bart oh the barbecue sauce okay okay that's good and oh and by the way apparently everyone else in their mom knew that this this opens lengthwise because it's supposed to be like a bowl because you don't have you know a plate but but no one else wanted to check the comments so there's like a million comments of people telling me the same thing of oh yeah it's because you don't have a plate out there you're supposed to use the dang that the package itself is your bowl and plate what's this apple jelly wonderful you know that's going in there creamer well this is this is a zero calorie sweetener I thought I thought calories were important so why would you make it zero calorie wouldn't you want to put calories into the thing because you're trying to put as much calories into the soldiers what the heck is this now ooh freeze-dried coffee and I you know if you're not getting yourself iodized you know who are you buddy you know get get your act together you got to get those ayodhya iodization 'z Enya and a moist towelette and when you're done you know just two pieces of gum dad there's a million things in here there's the long spoon there's the long spoon now correct me if I'm wrong but this spoon totally goes all the way down it so what's the I'm bringing this back up because you're supposed to do it lengthwise for the bowl but look this this easily reaches just this way it's so easy to do it this way instead of this way all right we got what the heck is this this is this is the breaded wheat snack that everyone's told me to hey watch out there's there's a poisonous packet in there that's gonna kill you as soon as you eat it so you know don't eat that so yes I will be aware not to put the poisonous the poisonous moisture-wicking also there's still more stuff tropical punch flavored there's no fruit juice in this in this juice that's the first time I've seen 0% juice usually it's like 5% well I don't think that's going in there I'm gonna drink this because I'm you know I'm already thirsty and there's the activator what is this now what you got to do math in the field ok well I got a cup I don't need to I don't need to mess with this bag so that's good well it's uh see the ingredients were going to use this was the SantaFe rice and beans Oh they'd even say that this was included you get santa fe rice and beans with the herbs with your beef patty yeah you like that chin yeah you can you can watch that chin all day long buddy all right ok let's open up these let's see how ribs shape they really are well that's you know disappointing oh hey mrs. sausage hey come look at this now when you see when you when you hear the phrase rib shaped rib shaped does that come to your it does look like a McRib it does but we're gonna we're gonna mix it with the rice and we're gonna mix it you know with the beans oh you know what I just realized I didn't heat this up do we really need to heat it up though it is precooked yeah well we'll heat up the the Magnificent rice and beans but boy if I could just tell you the smell that's going it is you can hear mrs. sausage gagging in the background all right I did forget to heat it up though that what that's a rookie mistake but you know you basically it's already it's already cooked so you yeah well like we're gonna we're gonna use these Santa Fe rice and beans and clean it all up there we go we did tear it in all right and it says to fill it with you know you know a sizable amount of water where's the overfill line well I'm pretty sure that that just went straight over the overfill line but we're gonna where's my where's my hot pocket sleeve this is are you heating up in there I don't think that this is heating up you better heat up when I tell you to heat up do we have a question from the audience okay it's heating up now I feel the heat God look at that just that rib sausage or it will be rib sauce is that rib that rib shaped pork patty is really just the star of the show all right they stay I think that's going to heat up at some point but they say you know not to do this inside because this the fumes are a little bit toxic so I'm supposed to shake it Oh how often do they want me to shake this all right Chuck I just you know and and you know they tossed its shots pretty good but in case that there was any where's now what did I do with the sauce there's more of that there's more of that sauce where it came from in this packet well I say well that's heating up well you know we don't really have much time to wait we gather that we got to get going here so go get the bowl out [Music] and it just it crumbles just the way you thought a rib should again that cutting it lengthwise makes total sense because you want to eat it like it's out of a bowl right people Oh the barbecue sauce isn't that bad well that's about as much of the rib meat that you got it kind of looks awful that sawdust that no one convinced me that that is not sawdust [Music] all right how long is this supposed to take the cook it feels it doesn't feel hot it feels warm it feels warm and I don't see any of that wonderful scheme that I saw in the last one you're soaked yourself why don't you eat enough get in there look that's a really matter if it's hot or not I mean if this thing starts heating up on its own I'm gonna be super super angry well this makes no sense to open it sideways well there's your brace and beans I mean that's why we're putting it through the grinder but why you know I made one comment that we put everything in the grinder and now you can't even make a water sausage without putting it in the grinder first where's Mike here we go turn this back on [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well what else what else I mean I feel like I've been transported to to Santa Fe New Mexico with with that with that rice see what we got here these are the hot pockets the pizza hot pockets you know I'm not going to put this in there because all it will do is just make it first it adds no flavor whatsoever so we know that from the last MRE what is it banana nut Ranger bar that definitely looks like a banana nut Ranger bar oh boy is that spicy what a mess what a mess all this is out there goes to spoon yeah all right give it you know we'll give it a little stir by the way that rib meat in case in case you're late that red meat is sawdust you know who's ever manufacturing the the rib meat boy are they having a laugh at the government's expense because that is sawdust there's no actual meat in there well I guess we should you know put it in the stuffer the moist towelette we're not putting the moist towelette in there you want all right let's have a vote who wants the apple jelly it takes about 15 seconds all right we have a no we have a yes we have a yes we have oh it's even oh no it's all right dude oh boy all right the guesses have it yeah we girl oh it's just so gelatinous you know think that open from the side you know otherwise you know how tearing it the other way that spoon would never have fit in there how would this have possibly have worked no only this way apparently oh you want me to turn on donate donations and I yeah so this was an accidental livestream public live stream so that setting isn't turned on this this was supposed to just be for patrons but I accidentally made it public so I owe my patrons another live stream one that is in public but yeah if you want to contribute you know buy a shirt or you know think about becoming a patron and then see you know live streams that you were supposed to be private but turned out to be public anyway so you know that could be that could be you right now everyone's favorite part of course is dealing with the intestines and you know they're like headphones that you know you would throw in your backpack and that they get tangled very easily the longer they are so you know a good amount of time is spent just trying to sort sort this mess out all right look we got some of that we got some of that rib oil still yeah we got we got this Darvish going on we cut to the stuffers not exactly at the same level as the board here get this a little wet give it a little grease why do you always have to make me look like a fool in front of people can't you just go on like a normal by the way this is cut out of every video me me messing with trying to get this in fact the entire live stream could probably just be me trying to get this done for an entire hour where are you [Music] good let them let them see my feet ah get up good god what a pain in the pain and uh you know I'm not sure if this is gonna stay up full or if I'm gonna make it a high light thing so I'm probably just not gonna swear you know I don't want to get demonetised again for almost saying the F word not saying it by the way not even I thought I found a loophole in a YouTube's you know thing there and they said you're not allowed to swear in the first 30 seconds on your video and you're not allowed to bleep out any swearing in the first second of your video or the first 30 seconds of your video otherwise you'll get demonetised well you know I'm not even gonna repeat it although it has been more than 30 seconds alright so what we're going to do now is not tie this off yet because we still need to we still need to get the air out of here so now it's right at the tube so now we can tie it off and not having to worry about this filling up with all that air and any questions from the audience I have mrs. sausage reading off questions so why oh I don't need this on anymore because there's no you know gases or whatever what's my day job this is my day job oh yeah I forgot that this wasn't you know so all of that made one sausage and I am not kidding oh you could get your sausage tasting either online but I get my sausage casing from the local butcher my butcher makes sausages in-house and so many butchers do and I said hey buddy can I get some of that sweet sausage casing that you're important and he said yeah so it came in a you know a plastic bucket and I took everything out and I put them in individual plastic bags am i speaking too fast oh the comments are just don't you so we're gonna give this tons of room because we are gonna let this expand like nobody's business all right note to self watch wash the kitchen shears when we're done with this I've been making sausages for I want to say ten years but it's probably closer to seven is that about seven or eight years I've been making sausages mostly normal so there haven't been any crazy lobster sausages or what happened supposedly it's just been you know trying to get back at the big big grocery for stealing all my sausage money there's two baby sausages I call oh well now we can't use that joke anymore not light a current current detentions do I not have a clean pan oh nothing like starting the live stream with the dirty pan missus sausage entertaining the folks who always wash the pan hey mister sausage do you have the time 12:27 we got it we got to get going because we have an entire under mr enoch are ya sure yes sir we're gonna try to get two of these - what he's done okay and another question for the audience do we poke holes or do we not poke holes no holes no hold that no I'm seeing I'm seeing more nose I'm seeing more nose than I am seeing no all right all right we're sticking with no on this one we'll compare all right I'm thinking you people just want to see a sausage versus butt is what I'm thinking all right that the count is in and we will not be poking any how many people are on right now oh my gosh well this was a very large turnout you know usually there's it's like 14 people because it's supposed to be just for the patrons but hey you know what it what a turnout what a turnout for an accidental public livestream what I just had the oil oh there it is no we had a standard we we got married in Vegas mrs. sausage and I oh wow that is way too much oil well there's gonna be a fire god no that's way too much that's you know safety first is is you know always what mr. sausage says safety first pumpkin and candy corn sausage for her for Halloween I want to make a blood sausage I think that would be appropriate I think everyone wants know how that mrs. sausage does but I think the blood sausage would be pretty pretty darn tasty you know in America we don't really appreciate blood sausages like the rest of the world does and it's a shame because it's a very it's a very good way to utilize all that blood alright these this home now oh sure why not here we go come with me and you'll see a world of pure imagination and things that we do involve saw suffocation Oh could you guys see my moustache did I reveal it on the livestream I may be I ain't got in the shot uh yeah so I've been growing this bad boy ever since the start of quarantine so that's been you know how many how many months now three or four months so I've been growing a mustache since then I revealed my face entirely oh well the jig is up the jig is up everyone oh yeah I know I did that but I meant did I do it on the livestream did I just go full on face here's my face everyone oh now I haven't okay well now that I want to do air sausage that seems like a fun one but you know there are you know microscopic holes in the sausage that will you know it eventually leaked out so it I don't think it would be possible to do an air sausage oh we got the side of my face well that's enough to it to make an identification she hates it misses sausage hates the mustache as well she should it's in it's in it's very itchy and and then it's I'm you know I've never really had a mustache at this length before I've kind of had like you know the the teenagers mustache that you know all boys do when they're around 17 years old but you know ever since then I never really come oh all the Santa Fe Rice all that Santa Fe Rice goodness oh no oh gosh now the oil splattering oh oh god that does not look appetizing oh I know what I'm a bad woman you don't think I've ever scooped out sausage enters into a hot dog bun before oh my god there's more than 5,000 people watching this what it work keep losing that spoon that's okay everyone loves the sound of metal on metal oh I forgot I left the stove on well rats well we we should have known that was gonna happen I was led astray by the don't poke holes in the sausage people so you can't blame that one entirely on me let's uh let's give this a shot see what it tastes like hmm it's really good um it kind of tastes like this you want to try it Oh Mitch the sausages didn't try it I'm like a 4 or 5 what do you think mrs. sausage Oh mrs. sauce is gonna eat it that's how good it is that's how you know I'm not lying she's gonna finish this it's really good it's really good it's a 4 or 5 habit of made it it's a the the red meat is well I mean it's sawdust but it's flavored like Park so it blends it tastes it's scientifically it's scientifically created to taste good so I don't know why we're surprised about this but it's uh it's uh you know we didn't get it in the casing but the inners itself mixed together they're surprisingly good it tastes it makes a really nice delicious treat all right so I think we have less than half an hour to do the other one so we better get cracking on this this is going right in the garbage and yes I will take requests for music if you guys need me to sing something you know just tell me what it is we can do more Wonka Wonka song I've been trying to get my kids to watch the 1971 version and they want I think they're coming around I think they're coming around at first they didn't know what to think how are you West Virginia fly me to the moon in West Virginia fly me to the moon I want to go to West Virginia Mountain Mama these are all good these are all these are all in my range let it go oh yeah the kids love that one how does that go but uh well I know it goes let it go let it go but there's like more to it than that esposito these are all good I so uh let's see and uh and and after all you're my Wonderwall I said maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me and you know take on me down at it at that oh there's the chicken look you look how beautiful these chunks are you can see the grid pattern that we're gonna be enjoying these these chicken chunks in all these the osmotics grant the current laws mutter cranberries are making a comeback these are good plain tortillas all right this is good these are really good first strike energy bar yeah apple cinnamon flavor that that seems fun that that seems like a fun one okay it's like Christmas in here M&Ms one full cheese spread with jalapenos now I believe if I recall watching MRE Steve that this is like this is like gold this is this is like very valuable for trading and what-have-you this is like one of the best tasting things if I'm remembering right this could this could be crap this is the the fruit punch from last time and the chicken and the beverage base lemonade that's sounds that sounds pretty good Oh buffalo style hot sauce and this is the this is just a gigantic bag of fruit beverage powder Oh add salt to the heater to make it work oh is it Jake Sloan thanks for the suggestion we'll add salt where that what I do with it did I just toss it willy-nilly what I do with it did this not come with the eater no that's the sleeve all right everyone in the livestream did you watch me just like Chuck the heater or maybe it doesn't get one maybe you'll eat a cold well this one's this oh there's no heater with this one well I guess that guess doesn't come with all well that's a rip all right let's say you know what I'm not gonna open this I'm not gonna open it lengthwise I'm gonna I'm gonna be a rebel that I am and cut it the way I think it should be oh this one you don't cut thankfully see this one they figure it out all right I'm not there's no eater to add salt to so we could just end that oh Jesus Christ all the chicken juice just spilled right out ah listen I think you can see that I'm not I'm not a man of combat oh there they are there's those chicken chunks and you say this is cooked good god that didn't that look cooked the things we do for the things we do for sausage all right who they putting this metal bowl back on a heater this this looks disgusting this this is it smells so bad [Music] oh there's more juice [Music] Oh [Music] it's spell all right osmotic cranberries do your stuff oh god it's true it's dripping in chicken juice [Music] and we need our energy so in chess I can't open it I mean my hands are just covered in chicken juice ah oh it's like a power bar yeah that's what it is [Music] [Music] right oh you want the M&Ms in there why not oh that was a terrible suggestion whoever wanted the M&Ms in there [Music] that just looked like we don't know what that looks like and here's I'm not gonna put all the tortillas in there because we don't want to oh the cheese spread I forgot about the cheese burger yeah [Music] all right and so we got that the cheese spread with jalapenos I don't think that's gonna go into the grinder because then we're gonna lose well lose most of the cheese spread in the grinder so come in and cut me a break with this one all that chocolatey jalapeno e goodness oh there's also um there's a buffalo style uh-huh hot sauce should that go in there too you tell me I'm gonna get this open because I know what the answer is yes I just saw one yes that's all I needed to see there you go what not to use to tie it off oh it's just a simple you do a loop it's it stays together with just one tie there's no special tie oh my god it stinks so bad it is entirely that she spread smell that fake cheese smell spread and I see little pieces of Eminem's can everyone see that there we go god it stinks no I'm not putting the fruit drink stuff in there because I'm thirsty and I do want to drink that after the after the live stream oh also I put this look I put this on top of the still hot a range of it what's just called stovetop no I didn't it didn't mouth even after being on top of the stovetop so that's really good alright it's get the are we getting a good shot of this here we can change the angle is everyone having a good time is everyone saying you know I'm glad ice but you know an hour watching this guy make some really ridiculous sausages God that that jalapeno cheese spread is just dominating dominating the census cleanup is going to be the worst it did Peter Griffin sing countryroads is that why everyone wants me to sing countryroads look it's kind of left it on here a little bit too long that doesn't want to budge keep going yeah all right so uh how's it go country roads take me home to the place I belong West Virginia Mountain momma take me home country roads I hear her voice in the mornin Mountain she calls me the radio reminds me of my home far away driving down the road I get a feeling like I should've been home yesterday yesterday country roads although it burst there we go no harm done that's what happens when you're too busy singing and not paying attention to the sausage well this made quite a bit more sausage than the other one in fact you know we should have put more casing on baby sharp well I think that this one's gonna be a bit of a problem just a second as we clean the pan out so crunchy so crunchy [Music] [Music] [Music] baby baby sausage come on kitchen what's this water and now we just wait for that pan to heat up and I don't know I can't get this thing off here all right where's my poker all right so we will poke we will poke the one that's closed off oh now this is poke did you can't poke that anymore this one we will leave on poke but with an open end oh yeah that's that's a lot of oil just put them in there I actually don't know the only part of that song I know is that the chorus I plus the rangedown gonna take some time to do the things we never had what Papa and Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Bombay red take my - hi - AG you that's just right outside my vocal range they wanted you to sing la Bamba oh well the one we didn't poke just burst so where my scissors my trusty Sydney they are just you know I'm thinking that these MREs they're not prime sausage you know making material all right we're gonna get this one out before he got a chance too all right okay this is the chocolate chicken the chocolate chicken Christ what else is in there apple cinnamon first-strike nutrition you got to M&Ms are in there I know there's a piece of tortilla in there too all right here we go we're gonna give this a shot it's so bad I had to spit it out that's a zero out of five people oh oh man not a good one to go out on well I think but I think what I think we learned a lot today um here here's some more of these this little these little guys uh we learned that combining chocolate and and jalapeno cheese spread is not a good combination with your your white chicken chunks and your apple cinnamon flavored nutrition energy bar that's what we learned today all right there's you know we still got we still got you know four minutes of the live stream left so you know I guess I'll keep singing and answering questions if you see any mister sausage Katy Perry I kissed a firework I didn't like that one I know I didn't yeah I'm not even gonna try a second bite that's how terrible that was that was a real shock to the system of how bad it tasted so like a total pig iron on his head that one yeah now unfortunately that's

  "34": "well hey there folks and welcome back I guess and boy is that is yeah we're doing this I guess we're going to be doing this I just realized that the fish that I purchased is way too big for the grinder here's the grinder and there's the fish and you know as we can see by the laws of physics you know which isn't going to happen I shall we got to find out another way to to get this guy in there take me to the river drop me in the water why yes that night give just likes my finger and do you know luckily luckily for us had the only band-aids we have in the house of these these frozen two band-aids this time it's personal well that was an ordeal you know it also says to not put you know the bones in the grinder it's more it's more of a challenge than it is you know an actual warning [Music] [Music] yeah we host it all right so uh no bones no bones in your meat grinders people [Music] this has been just a very scarring experience overall I don't feel any of the bones so you know I don't think we need to do another pass through so that's fantastic news and I think it just disintegrated it smells like if a if a fish came into my home and just left a fresh one right on the living room floor this is like the smoothest this is like the Cadillac of putting one of these things on here see this thing it pushes it down I mean that way we get the Gator out of it first that way it doesn't go into the sausage all right in 3 2 1 let sausage you know one of these days that's gonna that's gonna sound real nice here we go well there you go that's that's one whole snapper look at that there's no flat bottom on this pin so we're just gonna have to use this imported bean sprouts and water to kind of kind of make it level here all right in there 3 2 1 let's so it's sausage again we have the keys I think they're just too small that's not gonna do anything for you then this is just slightly too tall for it you're gonna tip it too much the other way and so the bean sprouts they just slide from right under and there we go we'll see how we did that's about what I was expecting I think we're in for a wonderful a wonderful gastronomic experience okay so I have to be careful because there are bones in this so the first point will be a very delicate bite so it tastes wise it's really not that bad it's a good day it was a good snapper so nothing wrong really with the taste yeah you know it tastes like it tastes like a fish it could have used a little bit more help maybe some pepper or maybe some garlic I don't know you know what the world's your oyster those small bones are definitely coming back to bite us because they are in there if you were to order this you know at a restaurant that's immediately you send back so in that sense it's a zero out of five however fish sausage is a real thing so you know this is easily going to be a five out of five if we just look up a recipe you know and don't you know throw the entire fish into the grinder if we were to ignore the bones taste-wise this would be like a three out of five so for what we did today because there's bones in there but not flavor-wise it's getting a zero out of five pop-pop-pop-pop written ",

what what's the misses sausage score where'd you get it i gave it a five out of five a three a three a solid three i think it was better i think i think it was better without all that buys by on its own and plus i've been into it it's like it's like the the meat's not like adhering or sticking to the casing so it's like you've got it's like a water balloon so that's why the juice came out because

  "78": "and uh boy everyone's uh here so early i i i didn't expect anyone uh to to be here right now i'm just fiddling fiddling around with the with the live stream settings so uh you know sit back and uh you know relax and uh you know you know give me a second you know there's no rush there's no rush it's halloween right you can give me a couple of minutes to figure out these settings hey everybody hey there uh andy foggs hey there uh that mimer good to see you and uh laurel ruiz thanks for stopping by on your halloween uh night to uh to spend a little halloween treat with me will we have some tricks no i i didn't really plan for any of that but we will be making a sausage which is you know without the whole point of why we're here so uh you know it's the end of the spooky month it's yes and it's a good day good to see uh so many people uh showing up oh look i just got a youtube reminder on my on my own phone that uh that that i'm streaming uh i should probably turn on like uh uh uh what's it called the do not disturb but i i don't wanna accidentally you know end uh the stream i always have to check the settings to make sure that you know that uh slow mode is turned on otherwise it the stream just gets inundated with so much chat so you go to more options and we'll just do that i'm sure there's a way to have that on by default but i haven't cared to uh look at that so that's you know that's why that's there so all right i think that's pretty good so uh oh no i i wasn't even looking at the donations already is there a way for me to look oh there we go a guillermo la desma hey happy birthday buddy thanks for the donation there and uh voltron force uh thank you as well is november going to keep me busy well yes but i mean i'm not going to be doing uh a a a a thanks a whole month of thanksgiving that's we just did that for october and uh i'm i'm you know tired i'm you know over it i'm ready for i'm ready to move on to tell you the truth and i think everyone else is as well and uh thanks lunch or uh lux i hope i'm saying that right next is a cream pie sausage well hey maybe maybe well it is after dark so maybe and elmer j fapp thank you so much would you be would you make a banana sausage sure uh you know banana might be the only fruit that's that that could be sausage ified since all the other ones are just so liquidy so you know here's a pie that we got from uh publix and uh i haven't tasted it yet so i'm gonna go ahead give it a shot oh it's a it's a waste to be turning this into a sausage or maybe not because this is a really good pot uh publix bakeries makes uh that not not even sponsored this video that just that's just a plug for their bakery because they they always come through in florida wherever you go anywhere you're going to get a publix treat and that's just that's just how it is and uh they did did i miss it okay good and uh strumming anyways thank you for the donation can you wish holding a happy birthday and halloween thank you we love you well yeah yeah of course i can do that hey uh happy birthday holden i hope you have a happy halloween thank you for joining me on this uh joyous occasion so i mean the first thing i mean that i mean it goes into the grinder right that's that's what we got to do oh my goodness and i gotta be i'm really hoping these i had uh thank you to uh marshall goodman a halloween festivus yes it is and uh sauce g no i'm serious thank you for the donut stop with the guys i got to start sausaging this thing at some point i ever thought of a of a spit sausage no you know i i hadn't thought of that can you say hi bear we're we're both watching i don't well is that that's not part of the quotes hi bear we're both watching but maybe that is part of it i don't know i work at a publix deli it's a nightmare but the tender subs are worth it yeah you know i i it's it's usually blasphemy to hear a public's employee say anything other than good things about public so that this is a rare treat tonight uh thank you for the donation and uh uh did i read your name off that was wesley mccormick i gotta get better at reading these names off uh cheese mcpease was the one who thought of the spit sausage and uh we got that one jonathan haggard was for the uh high bear and uh this is so much harder when you're by yourself uh happy halloween you make an enchilada sausage well that sounds like an order and uh you know may you probably we haven't done uh any mexican food besides tacos and burritos i think we should probably some you know some some some cuisines that maybe aren't so uh taco belly and chipotle uh oh i wait i need my measuring cup see when i say that there's zero prep work that goes into this show i mean it because but that measuring cup is like the that's like this when you come to ordinary sausage you think of the sausages and you think of that measuring cup so i'm doing a disservice to this live stream by by it not being here oh there it is there you are you're dirty you cannot be used we will have to settle for the younger brother which you know he tries his best you know he's you know he's not it not as good as as as the uh as as that one but you know he's just second in command let's see and kaylee rupp thank you for the donation can you possibly make awful sausage or awful sausage you know i've never heard anyone actually pronounced it only written so uh i'm stupid you should have you should have learned that by now watching this show uh yes we we there's more more some more innards are on the way of the animal uh let's see so uh tarantula wedding weddenberg no whipped cream uh no no whipped cream sorry about that buddy uh well there was whipped cream on the key lime pie sausage and that's like all i could taste ah i'd say scott turner thank you for the donation can you make a soup souffle sausage uh probably i'm about to go to trial voluntary manslaughter says cheese mcps all right all right let's okay stop donating let's let's start sausaging this is this is why we're here this is why we're here it's uh it's fight me it's certainly a fighter i don't think i've encountered this kind of a fight since the matzah that was that was the money shot we caught that just in time for that drop people people who just turned in right at that second that was the optimal okay that was the new optimal time that what that was a good that was a good clark it plurt right out of there did you cut you there we go so all right that that's that that's that's got to be enough right and look it we it was just enough it was the perfect amount of measuring cup to catch to catch our energy and uh this looks actually pretty appetizing i you know it what else could it look like it could it just turned like a brighter shade of what it was oh yeah all the pies always taste so good hey oh man i'm better missing like these donations like crazy oh i'm not good if i missed anyone a super fan keep track of any of any that i missed okay just make a sausage you want to make with the proper ingredients that's not what this show's about well robbie thomas but uh i appreciate the encouragement and uh schlemmer toots

london and i'll take over the donations so let me give you my assessment on this it's uh you know it's it's probably we should probably just mark it under disqualified because this is barely holding up as a sausage and it's really just i'm just basically ripping with my teeth through this and not even even getting casing it's like rubber it's so stretchy that i'm like dragging out the innards with my teeth so i you know of course the insides you know are crazy delicious because it's just concentrated sweetness as always someone just said one out of five in the chat and you know i'm yeah i'm thinking that's yeah that's probably yeah it's tough this is a tough one this is this one's a thinking man sausage hmm officially i'm i'm i'm ah [Applause] i don't wanna i'm gonna i'm gonna stick

  "88": "well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess well charlie it's uh you know it's thanksgiving or close to that thereof today we're gonna be we're gonna be doing the full thanksgiving meal to really celebrate the the meaning of this holiday that's what it's all about bringing the whole family together to make some quality sausages here in your dojo your neck of the woods well i mean it's my house but like you're we're gonna try our best not to screw this one up folks charlie what turkey's basically poisoned when it's in its raw state it's leave it to hell alone case in point you see all that yeah what is that that's yucky turkey water i need to get this turkey out of here kind of scared me away from turkey though you make it sound like a bomb turkeys in the united states suffer from a high degree of diseases so basically this thing's riddled with salmonella do i need like a gas mask or anything with a fumes toxic no the fumes are perfectly okay in fact but stick your head in there oh wow yeah she smells real fresh it's been thawing for three days in my backyard sweating up it's a million degrees in this house charlie he's trying to cook the boot and that's the turkey gravy hold on let's shove our hands right in you got to get right in there charlie we got screwed on the giblets instead they replace it with this gravy i don't know anything about coke hold on it's still frozen in there feeling like a heartbeat what's going on down there i think we found a giblet now you want to get in here with your big meaty paws you probably rip that out and crush it in the palm of your hand all right show me what am i trying to get here oh yeah it's pregnant look at that oh yeah good giblet uh you're starting a lawnmower come on baby rip road the turkey king is the one who can pull the giblet out here i'll hold the turkey down you get in there okay really pull spread its legs for me it keeps like closing in and like kegeling on me there it is wow that was a lot bigger than it is normal giblet size that's uh that's king-sized uh giblet oh charlie's mom it's good to see you again what the heck is this thing now oh wow oh oh wow what is this is that supposed to say in the turkey this no all right so i'm thinking a little salt a little pepper yeah of course how do you use time do i just like put the leaves on i'm assuming we're just gonna shove just just shove stuff into this bird i think that's the way they do it on tv as well i think it's pretty good technique actually i can see you drooling over there man it's delicious i've been trying to avoid eating it you said i'd get salmonella oh yes you will now now we've got our onions and you got to keep just cramming stuff into this bird oh you know what now we don't have room for stuffing i always prefer lemon onion thyme and sage instead of stuffing anyway i think we already have pre-made gravy so yeah just yeah lock it back in there the s you should call up your friends at adam and eve and tell them a new line a new line for them just for the holidays do we want to keep the the plastic on here no you know that's a that's a keen eye you got there charlie that that's why this is a group effort have you cooked a turkey before no do you want me to turn the oven on is that where the show is oh are you sure not it doesn't mean is this something we eat or is this just going to be like an ornamental decoration you know when the occasion comes you'll know that'd be amazing if this is the one that gets me demonetized let's turkey yeah there we go all right charlie we did a fantastic job on that turkey now we're missing the green bean casserole now this is one of my favorites so i hope we don't screw this one up that's impossible i'm gonna need you to open up four of these cans okay drain them and then dump them in the pan yeah in this all right fourth can of green bean initiated oh we got a little aluminum in there oh that feels nice you know this this this takes me back to i think i have all the cream here let me share let me share some of my cream with you oh here we go how's that that's big let's get in there now this looks like an oven that's never been used that's potatoes microwave instructions plastic lid and packaging and these instructions are the same so we won't be tearing the entire thing off this no you might as well keep it consistent yeah i agree charlie use your rat fingers to tear that off oh god wow charlie this this smells like a hospital this this is the mashed potatoes and i got to tell you they do not look mashed to me they look granulated oh my gosh i guess that's why you gotta cook it yeah i guess the heat does something to it that's the sound of flavor and charlie i say we go for uh we go for broke and we pour it all in let's get it i'm ready so do you want to start with the mashed potatoes let's start with the mashed potatoes and gravy okay we'll cross beans oh we don't want to forget the grave we gotta loop this up oh yeah absolutely thank you matt oh there we go yeah they tell you not to use your hands but i really don't see any other way i mean at some point you you you gotta you gotta grab life by the horns this is a fine looking sausage i think we're gonna get out of this well you know i think we could use some cranberry sauce with this oh wow that's what the bag's for i see she's scooping it this is really how the sausage is how you bring thanksgiving to your family's house [Applause] i mean this is gonna need two passes i mean look at that i mean it's gonna need it look at that oh yes it's it's turning back into ocean spray uh juice it's it it's starting to smell like thanksgiving don't be afraid of it get your hands right on it this is one of the heaviest sausages that that we've ever had on the show and who could forget green bean casserole the the onions not only provide a little bit of crunch needed crunch and two to our mix here uh but just flavor in general oh i agree one more scoop for luck it's appearing to me that we're running out of room so here let me let me do a quick oh there we go it's so hot to the touch it's getting there actually it's time for the main event yep just the classic american holiday i think we're we're setting a new tone for thanksgiving but if we turn it on let's suck it in no all right it's it's time for plan b oh the relief can i get you in the face there the dark meat that's the that's the leg this is a beautiful breast yeah it's so good i thought it was paper towel yeah really plunge it in there oh there we go oh whoa whoa she's really firing that's the white meat in three two one let chashed [Music] oh my lord that is something that you would go to the doctor for right there you need help yes i do yeah this is gonna this is gonna

hot it almost looks like jelly it's sweet here we here we go i can't i need something to there oh no no no no no no is it too hot is it going to burn me i don't think so it's actually very good here let me know allow me to don't want to do it and mrs sausage spit it right out you didn't like it i loved it i thought it was great what didn't you like about it mrs sausage there's a paper towel right here mrs sausage so to me it tastes good it tastes like it tastes like uh uh it has a solid gingerbread crunch to it that's what i like about it well i did maybe you just pulled all the juice out to the front and like scraped it with your teeth instead of taking a good bite so it had the solid gingerbread core to it which i loved i love that thing and the the the sugar uh uh it caramelized uh and it tasted like a roasted marshmallow almost the the the downside is well you could you can just see how how mushy this this bad boy is it probably would have tasted bad before it went to the sausage into the casing or the grinder i don't think so mrs sausage doesn't have quite the sweet tooth as mr sauce is just are you missing any doughnuts i'm trying to get the taste out of my mouth it's good no it's not i'm gonna have to give this ah you know the mush the mush is a factor so here's the thing we screwed up by putting in the eggnog oh that's what that so that's where we went wrong we didn't have to put the eggnog in the the frosting uh lubed it up enough huh negative one i'm gonna have to give this sausage a three out of five yes a three out of five it's like a negative no it tastes it tastes better than funnel cake i don't buy that it it i it has a very nice and plus the little candies that are all in there that's very pleasant look at it it like it burst i know it burst but did you fail giant puddle all over the stove but we got an end that survived it's like you poured soup and it's starting to slip but we got an end that survived um noob x cube can you please say let's

hard-boiled egg cooker or any style for that matter a classic uh omelette maker and this thing i will admit that i have the damnedest time uh trying to cook my my eggs properly here's some pictures of some eggs you know we need we need some eggs for this for this uh test i i want to try uh uh soft boiling these eggs to me soft boiling is the hardest one to get right then you gotta just ever so gently just all right in there then you put it the the cap on here and then you then you turn then you turn it on and then then you wait this thing just started this it started singing on me this is just gonna keep doing that i hope i don't get a copyright strike for this all right so let's let's let's see if it worked all right that's it that's enough out of you you know what yeah that's probably soft-boiled how to get it out of the shell is the next problem we're gonna we're gonna this is gonna be a battle of the who's got the omelettius omelet so something that i learned off camera is that this thing turns on as soon as it's plugged in this one we gotta fill it up with water and this one doesn't require any of that kind of nonsense and then the rest is for oh it's already going i guess each one of these things uses you know two two eggs and then this thing goes here and then we're here we go we gotta we got a battle going [Music] all the songs back all right well there's our omelette and as you can see it's you know not looking as as as such this this one i think is is done as well there's one omelette and here we did bam there it is here's your omelet right there they may not look like the most appealing omelets and heck the pepper just floated straight on this one that side's not better let's try a little piece here of our omelet this one tastes like you you you microwaved a cup of eggs and and now we'll try the what have you over here it mostly tastes like scrambled eggs i'm ready to make a a determination on these first two products if you live in a place where you know you don't have access to a pot of water this is a good replacement for that so i would say for the for the hard-boiled eggs that this is definitely worth uh buying all right now this thing on the other hand is uh not very good it doesn't make your eggs into omelets it makes it like uh baked eggs uh so should should you buy should you buy the omelette maker no you shouldn't buy it now we're moving on to the to the to the all right so we got the rolly here and just this a very thick owner's manual this is this is too many pages to be reading in order to operate this you may need to shake it out of there or poke it with a stick is what this thing tells you so it doesn't work half the time and and now for one to two large eggs all right i admit that was that was too much force oh good lord i love that noise that's a beautiful noise all right here we go here it's done look at it girl oh my god it's like it's taking a sh let's see how this this rolly compares well i probably should have washed this before using it because the whole thing tastes like chemicals should you buy it no you shouldn't buy it i'm sorry missha oh i am for real oh i i did not need to see the egg water i bet you i can gross out all the viewers in three two one let's uh who keeps shutting this thing to go off it's me i'm the one who keeps shutting it so that it goes off that's exactly how i like my egg sausages as thick as the day is long you came to the wrong side of egg town buddy will it blow this thing's not blowing anywhere i i award you zero mark ruffalos let's go gary busy sausage you know what we haven't done a sausage flipping forever they keep bursting when we do it so i mean so that's the primary reason but you know let's yeah let's do it anyway that's exactly why we stopped doing the sausage flips in the first place and so that that's you know what it looks like on the inside just completely cook you you've never seen an egg cook this much in your life all right and now we'll you know put it in a barn and eat it and then then then we wait for the next show to happen but first we got some fan mail to open hold hold on let me get this screen bigger this package comes all the way from the country of austria and there it is looks like some of this guy's work we're dealing with a professional here all right i gotcha i got some oil on the packaging but what is better than a mark [Laughter] my ruffalo terry this is perfect i can't thank you enough thank you mrs sausage we're gonna have to find a place of high honor for this and now on to the tasting put it right in the thing right there you know no time like the present you know i said it before the last time we made an egg sausage and i'll say it again this is not bad at all obviously the recipe can be improved upon since we only seasoned it with salt and pepper and the inside taste of the uh rolly i think that this one day could be a five out of five sausage but this sausage in particular i'm gonna give this sausage in particular a three and a half out of five we now have an answer on how long it takes for me to go through an entire package of sausage casing the answer is six months six months how do you how i forgot how you open these things ",

  "176": "well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess so we're do we're doing we're doing yet today this is the first time that we're gonna be using a a traditional uh grinder there's a reason people don't use you know old grinders anymore and it's easier just to throw something in an electric grinder and be done with it in seconds rather than good god hours i actually think this has the wrong attachment on it because this says that this is a bread crumber at the end of the day i think we'll have some pretty decent yak sausage before the internet if you wanted yak meat you needed to know a really weird guy you know game meats typically a very lean meat and you need as much fat as possible to not make a dry sausage this is still frozen in the center this one's a little bit more frozen it's easier to cut that way that's a little that's a little wet that's looking a little wet on the camera this isn't gonna be enough fat to not dry out the sausage so i'm gonna incorporate some pork fat with it you know but the first thing we got to do is cube this up into like one inch pieces this is a little bit too thought you want you want this a little bit firmer than that to cut look at how lean this meat is there's no fat there at all this one's a lot more frozen this is about the consistency you want to cut so when this was originally uh constructed in in 1899 i guess that they had thinner countertops back then this doesn't fit the countertop we have a simple solution here we're just gonna have to hold on for dear life when we start cranking this thing we're gonna load her up which um with some delicious yak meat and we're gonna see if we can turn it into into uh breadcrumbs apparently just completely missing the plate underneath it what the hell is this this is quite a work out here hold on i'm sending in some some reinforcements there can only be one king of sausage town baby this is this is the original meat spin i'll tell you one thing i'm i'm not gonna be regrinding it using this old grinder now to season this thing we're gonna we're gonna keep it pretty simple because we want the taste of the yak to really shine salt black pepper garlic powder onion powder paprika powder mix it all up there pork fat and pound [Music] and just a little bit of water to this thing so that it can go through the tube a little easier days go by let the sausage hold me down would you like some yak sausage it would probably be a good idea to put casing on the tube at some point in three two one let's shush that doesn't look bad at all i'm feeling i'm i'm in a linking shorter mood how how about you i i got a good feeling that this raw yak is gonna blow so will it blow i yes it did look at that came right out of the tube it's almost like its own show you know we'll cook that up too why not well like did you you know i'm gonna give that will it blow one mark ruffalo's we're not gonna cook all these up i'm gonna cook up just a few of them so we'll get that guy and this guy we'll try those two bro you dropped your olive oil time to share these suckers and this guy too let's open them up and see how again there that certainly sausage like gives like this guy its own personal taste it's exquisite one of the most flavorful sausages that i've ever had the pleasure of making the yak meat is extremely tasty it tastes like a very clean meat i said let's forget the bun and let's just try this sausage as is so uh here we go folks this is an experience just amazing it's it's so juicy it's so flavorful i i can't get over how good it is i've never made anything this good before there's only one score that this could possibly be this is a six out of five this is this is why you get like the meat blaster 8000 instead of hand cranking these out ",

i started this episode i did a little prep work and i got the meat all nice and cut up and i stuck it in the freezer for about 30 minutes so that it's nice and firm so let's take a look at the goods the package is two and a half pounds of pork butt but we're only going to use half of that and likewise with the bacon we're using half the bacon so the first thing we're going to do is grind our meat then add spices and then regrind it [Applause] [Applause] i'm thinking i'm feeling that christmas spirit chestnuts roasting on an open fire a jack of frost nipping at your nose yeah garlic powder onion powder high end pepper pepper and salt give it the mix it deserves use your hands people there's nothing to fear okay now that's ready for a second grind what are you nuts we gotta put the candy canes in first like like seven to ten candy canes fold it in fold that right on it there they're in there but but i can't see them i i guess we're gonna need a few more candy canes to even this out

reservations about eating kangaroo no to me they're just giant rats that hop around you wouldn't need a rat you don't know me let's get a close-up of this mrs sausage i'm very excited about this i've never actually had kangaroo before it looks like normal meat all right what an um what an unveiling this was looks can be deceiving because this thing it smells livery livery it smells like a liver let's cook up a little piece of it and give it a try before we turn it into sausage and yeah we're gonna hit it with a lot of salt and even more pepper that's probably way too much salt all right now we're now we're slightly cooking shouldn't we have an event i mean you should we're not selling this meat so it's perfectly okay to be cooking and eating meat that's made in your basement for your health well papa's got sausages to make have you seen her i'm not going to make all this into sausage we'll do like one or two loins and and and maybe save it depending on how good this steak turns out tell me have you seen it it's the venison of the bush it's the buffalo of the of the uh ocean what is this 300 it's way too hot this seems like too much oil in too much heat but here we go is it a fatty cut no this is a very lean meat which brings me to my next point good sausage is fatty i didn't have any fat so i went out and bought this salt pork i don't know if you're supposed to use this for sausaging or not but it looks like it's got plenty of fat on it so we're going to mix the kangaroo in with this salt pork and hope for the best did this thing stop cooking starting to burn you know who you don't see a lot of these days rob zombie we probably could have used a little bit of olive oil and a little bit of butter ooh and a sprig of rosemary i'm not going back upstairs no we don't have any of that we're going to try to find a spot for this where it hasn't been contaminated with raw kangaroo meat here we go there it is a perfect raw however the end piece has got to be done that's like a medium it's on your oh well that's what it's for it's a lot gamier than than than normal beef on the on the rare end it kind of tastes like filet mignon well that was a good treat however we're not here to make kangaroo steaks like some sort of chunk we're here to make kangaroo sausage with salt pork we got our kangaroo meat let's begin you know the drill we're gonna chop up this meat mix it in with pork and and then turn it into a sausage just look at how rare that is it's almost blue it looks like tuna nothing cuts meat better than a chinese vegetable cleaver let's get this pork skin off of there that's kind of you kind of don't want to eat the skin and we'll stick it in the freezer for 30 minutes we got our almost frozen meat here salt pepper garlic powder onion powder just a hint of of of cayenne pepper [Applause] it's regrowing time [Music] that looks pretty good i i i almost wish we had a little bit more fat in there to be honest with you when you're stuffing the sausage stuffer you become the sausage stuffer here we go you don't you don't want to rush these things there is a small chance of the casing tearing on the sausage tube looks like we

  "304": "this episode of ordinary sausage is brought to you by bright sellers now you may not consider me the most intellectual person when it comes to wine i used to buy my wine at walgreens or cvs you could go to a grocery store you could go to a liquor store and you'll be completely lost in the wall of wines that they have you don't know what you want go to the bright sellers website take the quiz and and they'll give you wine that you'll actually want you tell bright sellers i i like puppies but i also like to eat a bag of skittles and they'll be like oh well then obviously a cabernet is is what you should be drinking of course my favorite wine is the pinot noir [Music] and the best thing about bright chillers is they include these special cards in the packaging so you can sound like you know what you're talking about when you invite your friends over this pinot noir also has aromas of rose petals and baking spices that carry over to the palate yeah you can smell the strawberries well sponsors like bright sellers help keep the channel going so go ahead and buy a couple boxes and brightsellers is giving my followers 50 off their first six bottle box you can get all of this for just 55. i like the lighter wines the wider the white ones now of course the first thing you need for sangria is fruit that's about to go bad i i can't explain it myself i'm i'm pretty sure this is how they make wine in prison i think you can just use whatever fruit you got that whatever fruit that's about to expire we're gonna just jam-pack this thing with as much fruit as we can a little strawberry action too [Music] who doesn't love a good strawberry drink and we'll throw in a lime just just so that we can say that we did that now i think we got some sangria fruit going here our fruit medley's pretty fruity at this point let's finish this off by dumping in the wine now if you're going for a traditional sangria you should be using a spanish red wine but we're going to be using pinot noir since that's my favorite kind of wine and i read that you can just substitute it out with that anyway so we're not breaking any laws we'll just dump some brown sugar in it to up that sweetness that's a pretty half full pitcher of wine so we're going to be opening up another one of these bright cellar wines to help round out this this picture this one's called rising tail and it's also a pinot noir and it's got uh you know it's got you know half the stuff that we put in the picture already it's got you know some strawberries and well i guess it's just strawberries now that's looking like some sangria it's time to sweeten up this wine give it a mighty stir give it a little taste test oh yeah that's that that's the stuff all right but of course we're not here to make sangria we're here to make sangria sausage time to load up the pork and then enjoy and end there gotta put the pork in the sangria if you want to make me scream bro i don't i don't know i don't know if there's enough room for all this pork it's a little too much here well we we gotta drink some of this you mix the pork in you mix the pork out you mix the pork in and you screw it all up and that's what it's all about right foot all right i'm gonna put this in the freezer for a few minutes make sure that pork is still firm when we throw it in the grinder well we it it turns out pork doesn't freeze in an alcohol based solution so we're just gonna have to try our best [Music] oh okay oh it was plugged up it was plugged up this is gonna be an awful sausage a little seasoning the last thing you want to say is boy i wish that sangria sausage had some salt in it i don't practice sangria i that's looking like some fine sausaging material you know i i bet the ancient romans they they probably ate sausages just like this the decadence all right in three two one let's josh this is going to be one leaky sausage i'm just warning everyone in advance man the ruffalo box is getting nasty it's been nasty but now it's now it's starting to smell once again thank you bright sellers for this will it blow oh that was a tasty will it blow uh it looks like we got a piece on the sausage art that's you know not something that we try to do i'm gonna have to give that will it blow four mark ruffalos all right it's it's a drippy boy it's it's it's hard to it's it's unwieldy all right here we go it's starting to look veiny think this sausage is is as cooked as it's gonna get let's let's let's open it up and uh see how we did [Music] uh so far so good it it you know it looks cooked ever so lovingly place it in the bun sangria sausage here we go it's a it's it's overpowering the fruit rinds are are taking hold of this sausage and they're not letting go it tastes like everclear is what this sausage tastes like it's it's it's it's it's quite strong you know you gotta take risks when you're making sausage maybe we shouldn't have put the fruit rinds in maybe there was too much liquid when we started the skin cooked for like 20 minutes and still it's as slippery as the devil himself it was a fun sausage to make not a fun sausage to eat thanks again to brightsellers for sponsoring this episode i'm going to have to give this sausage here a 1 out of 5. everyone loves sangria especially if you're a woman in her 40s ",

  "324": "well hey there folks and uh welcome to my apology video slash tequila sausage video what am i apologizing for well on tuesday i accidentally released two videos the aloe vera sausage and the tequila sausage at the same time what a so how does such an accident occur well the truth of the matter is i record these videos a week in advance that way in case if i get sick or injured or if an act of god calls me away from these videos at least there's a week to entertain you the fans some questions you may have is is it worse that this mistake was done on a sponsored video yes a lot worse question number two how did you confuse tuesday and friday with each other i and question number three are you naked underneath that sausage costume yes and it's starting to get hot and itchy but anyway i apologize for this mistake uh but without further ado for everyone else who hasn't seen it it's done it's the tequila sausage well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess now with with this sausage i figured that instead of pouring the alcohol directly in it we would uh grind the the the already made sausages in the tequila mixture so that it won't taste uh awful i think just dumping the alcohol right into the sausage meat uh does not make for a good sausage sausage prediction i think that this one's gonna be a four out of five okay let's do it [Music] all right we're going to season this with classic tequila seasoning salt not not not so much the pepper and limes well that's that's it that's a bit of a mess right there in the summertime you've got sauce that you got sausage on your mind all right in three two one let yourself [Music] gonna link these sausages up all right so we got three sausages out of that and then then we're gonna give that tequila some entry points into the into the sausage yep oh man why didn't i learn from the last time with that with special thanks to today's mark box hello box art this guy i was writing the fence about using this one because i wasn't sure if i wanted to give this thing physical form but anyway this will it blow is brought to you by misin do you like knives do you like to cut things with your knives does it help keep the voices away or does it make them angrier anyway knees and knives or more specifically mies and chef knives the most important tool for professional or home chefs alike or if you make sausages in your basement i love my new miso knife and not just for its looks this thing slices dices and chops without cramping my hand or my style and it keeps its head sharper for longer than those other more expensive knives you've seen you know on the internet in fact knees and knives are 2-3 times less expensive than other premium knife brands i use this knife for everything whether i'm cutting meat and vegetables for dinner or cutting up fruit because apparently no one else in my house knows how to do that and by the way these knives are guaranteed for life so feel free to get silly

well i'm gonna have to give that while i blow like like like will you i'm gonna have to give that will it blow one mark ruffalo's all right this is this has been brining for about an hour and i you know it's it's turning well first of all the bag's leaking i i think we should try boiling these in tequila as well now unfortunately my induction cooker won't work on a pot with a bottom like this but if we use a little science what am i doing i have a whole bag of tequila for this that that seems like a dangerous amount of tequila helping the heat transfer here but of course i'm not a scientist i'm a sausages wow look at that tequila does boil you know like we've we today's episode we've we've learned so much wow it's really boiling all right this this has been boiling for like five minutes i'm gonna get these out of here stop spinning there we go and then we'll finish up with a classic sausage shear okay here we go all right i i think these little i think these guys are are pretty much done i think i've maybe made these things a little too small they're they're they're like half half the size that they probably needed to be oh wait we gotta chop one first oh let's open this up and see how we did wow it flew right off the board ah it looks like a sausage okay let's uh let's okay let's try it here we go ah it's good it's actually very light on the tequila flavor even though it was boiled and brined in it uh it has a light tequila aftertaste i i taste almost none of the lime that we put in i guess all that lime cooked out i get really the only problem is it doesn't taste enough like tequila you only get a little bit of tequila aftertaste i guess we probably could have put a little tequila in the meat mixture i i think i was spot on in the beginning with my prediction i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 4 out of 5. i don't i don't know what what exactly is fuming out of this thing but uh i'm gonna have to crack open a window down here ",

  "354": "but hey there folks and welcome back I guess oh yeah yeah that glass bottle would have been a bad thing so we got our Guy Fieri's trash can nachos and uh we got our our Jesus for nachos 11 steps but anyway let's see what we got we're gonna start with the with the with the trash can itself now what this looks like to me is that they took a big can of beans and emptied it and stamped this right on it we have a bunch of uh corn tortilla chips we got uh Guy Fieri's uh brown sugar bourbon Josh is this a memory foam pillow made out of space age material that won't open this whole thing cost me ah it did not arrive unscathed it broke the cheese sauce broke open not not a huge loss of cheese sauce we'll we'll make do uh we got our cooked pork there shredded cheddar a jalapeno which I gotta cut up it looks like shower cream red onions covered in the Leaky cheese sauce he got a guy always I'm thinking it could have arrived you know not broken that would have been a big benefit of this thing don't they do any like stress testing on these things before they just go Whole Hog on their shipping method that's what a hundred dollars gets you for for trash can nachos well all right let's let's get to the 11 steps that's like 10 steps too many all of this has to be assembled upstairs so I gotta I got a haul all of this upstairs I'll see you guys by the NSE stove 11 steps 11 of them this episode is not sponsored by hellofresh or anything but those meals are entirely from scratch and there's only like six steps all right so that's everything about this is is falling apart so quickly on me you want me to my wave what's left of the cheese sauce so we're gonna dump it in this bowl once again I I need to remind you all that I'm doing 11 steps for for trash can nachos gonna do that there's no business like the shredded cheddar business I think I gotta make up for the lack of of cheese sauce that's currently on there here here here's the meat here's the dirty meat that belongs on top of these nachos all right we're gonna get that centered right under the broiler at 400 degrees and to add insult to injury you got to cut your own jalapenos up everything else has been cut up for you just not the jalapenos but like listen no you know Guy Fieri never said the way to flavor town was easy we're gonna we're gonna lick this train wreck continue on the next step is they want you to put all of this on a plate this is my largest plate and there's there's no way all of this is going to fit on my largest plate Guy Fieri fuels his his gas tank to flavor town with my money beep beep so long sucker we finally get to use the trash can there it is that's gonna I I'm pretty sure this bowl is not even big enough now you gotta shove it all in the bowl which how how realistic is this really just just if if I make it out of here alive tell my wife I think of her fondly there's too many chips God I I hate you so much Guy Fieri yeah making room for more of these chips that obviously weren't measured there it looks it looks like the trash can it was named after and we're still not done I guess I guess it's too much trouble to to package the cheese sauce as good as you did this squirt bottle of sour cream add the pico de gallo in the center for some reason it says to do that and the pickled onions like there's no room for any of this garbage couple sprigs of cilantro to class this whole thing up I don't know how long it's been in in in in in in video time but it's been like 30 minutes of of this remember they wanted you to put this on a plate I I came up with the idea to put it in a large bowl there God there it is there's the nachos holy holy God after all that being said let's let's let's try one of these chips shall we will get some of that pickled stuff on there these are actually really good nachos now we gotta go downstairs and throw the entire thing in the grinder and why the fresh jalapeno everything else is up 11 it doesn't take me 11 steps I I can't think of any other meal that takes 11 steps we've we've run out of room [Music] [Applause] [Music] I I don't even know what this is gonna fit in the canister was was I angry about the cheese breaking yeah cash was I angry that I had a chop a jalapeno even though everything else was prepared for me sure but the thing that makes me angriest is the 11 steps for nachos 11. hey Guy Fieri do you want more money and he's like yeah get her done or whatever the hell he says I'm so mad I I nacho Nacho Man I'm Guy Fieri I'm laughing my way to the bank in 11 let your change foreign what a terrible experience this whole thing has been with special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy it doesn't it doesn't blow zero Mark ruffalos for that one and quite deserving for this episode stupid guy fiately stupid nachos I just feel so defeated here we go I can't believe anything it didn't burst at all it's it's a perfectly cooked sausage fish real quick beautiful all right let's open this shop and see how we did Chuck you know it's like it's you know stuffed with tortillas here we go it's great it's a it's a very good sausage it you know of course it tastes like tortilla chips but it also tastes like all the stuff that went into the tortilla chips so you get the pulled pork taste you you you get the you get the cilantro it's a little mushy because of you know it's one almost 100 percent tortilla chips oh but that's that's not that's not a disqualifying factor in our sausages look I I may have said some things that were unkind to Guy Fieri and uh yeah and I meant that but this sausage it it kind of makes the whole thing worthwhile the chips may be a pain in the butt to make but there's still a five out of five the sausage however I'm gonna deduct at one point for for the mushiness but other than that I really love this sausage this whole thing will be eaten in sausage form so with all that being said I'm gonna have to give this sausage here up four

  "356": "well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess now normally when we do a shosh heavy episode we poke holes in the sausage and we watch all the sauce drain out in the pan today's gonna be different though because i bought a smoker and we're gonna smoke this tabasco sausage we're gonna smoke this tabasco sausage for two hours but of course we're starting with our classic base of of pork bites and then we're just gonna put way too much sauce into it we're putting our meat in the grinder first and then we're gonna cover it in the most delicious of sausage which is actually not true a sweet baby raise is is a more delicious sauce than tabasco and you can put that on my headstone wait should i have used sweet baby rays for this instead of tabasco that probably would have made more sense a barbecue sauce for a smoked sausage probably would have made more sense but we already did a sweet baby ray sausage so you know that's that's the end of that you know who would love to see this mrs sausage hey mrs sausage you want to come down here and see this no all right moving on then [Applause] and there's our beautiful ground sausage or in hurts it's not quite a sausage yet until we add salt oh and and and and plenty plenty of black pepper this is this is going on the smoker so so more black peppers are good and then of course we put the the uh to oh man this is going to take forever we want this to uh to really have that tabasco flavor in it it smells a little spicy in here smells a lot spicy i'm gonna sneeze oh that's gonna sting now that's a spicy a meatball and just a little bit more you're gonna save some of this for the kids ice cream zero calories not bad it's a healthy choice i've seen fire not seen sausage yeah that one's not very good but with the sausage might be better that's a that's a lot of tabasco water where is this water coming from oh my god oh my god little unintended consequences right there in three two one let's just [Music] this is a liquid that's not wanting to come out peacefully it's almost as if the sausage is being cooked by the tabasco sauce well i get i i guess that's it that's it that's a disappointing amount to to come out of there i guess we'll have we'll have enough for two sausages these these are some ugly looking sausages i i don't know i think tabasco may have been the wrong ingredient for this what's special thanks to today's mark box hello box artist barry is down there he's the he's he's the brown girl can you believe the nerve for 11 steps for nachos not 10 not a nice round number like 10. we got him we got him right in the face how's it feel you 11 step a pretty below average blow but we we did manage to to knock them out so i'm gonna have to give that will it blow two mark ruffalos normally we would poke these right about now but we're gonna we're gonna not do that because they're going in the smoker now well we we we we have a bit of a mixed result here on the one hand it looks like they have a ball sack uh and on the other hand they've developed uh some nice some nice smoke color but this is all just i think tabasco and fat drainage let's cut the shacks off i think our sausages were a little too loose we should have just made like one thick one we'll do what we'll do a sausage autopsy on on one of these sausages here we'll cut it it looks okay so you know that's what it looks like on the inside it looks it looks good we place it in our patented hot dog bun that's it's a that's a dry looking sausage well all right here we go i can't break the skin the skin is is as chewy as chewy can be i can't break it this is after me trying to gnaw on the skin for for a good while it tastes like a slim jim and a chorizo but i cannot break into this skin i'm gonna go with tabasco's a bad idea for sausage it's basically an edible you can't penetrate that skin once it's in your mouth the flavor of the meat's good although it's it's a little loose as you can see i i there's something weird going on with tabasco and meat i think it cooks it like lime cooked shrimp so you know the sausage is you know basically it's basically you know not good the smoke combined with the tabasco flavor is great this it's it's it's totally a five out of five flavor combo the rest of this is is like trash flavor-wise it's a five out of five no no no question there texture-wise and everything else wise it's a dump almost a disqualified level sausage just because of how cumbersome it is to eat this thing i have to give this sausage here a one out of five you know when we use the smoker again we'll use an ingredient that's not so gonna ruin the sausage ",
  "357": "well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess brisket trimmings how how did we end up with brisket trimmings instead of the actual brisket as you know from the previous episode i bought a smoker oh my god and i i its first test run was with a texas style barbecue brisket and if you make a lot of smoked brisket at home or if you've watched a lot of barbecue brisket videos on youtube like i have you know that you end up with just a ton amount of waste there's so much fat every video the guy's like i know this seems wasteful but we're gonna use the trimmings for something else as they throw pounds and pounds of brisket into the garbage but one of the things you can do with brisket trimmings is is to make them into uh into sausages so that's what we're gonna do this isn't one big piece of brisket there's different pieces of brisket in there especially this piece it's still kind of heavily frozen so let's get to the chopping we got a nice fat cap there and we got nice pieces of meat every piece of steak we've tried to do with sausage with it's always ended up tasting like hamburger and just how well did my first time brisket turn out drier than the sahara desert mistakes were made those two sausages dangling in the smoker from last episode that was kind of embarrassing i i figured we you know you put put put a little bit more sausages in there for the visuals this is just the meat part that i scavenged off of the brisket there's still all the fat that i also took off of it this is the bag that's almost entirely fat if the meat part of the brisket didn't have enough fat on it i was gonna use some of this to to even things out we'll just take this end right there wow swinging a mess huh the fat chips a lot easier than it does break and the rest of this i don't know for an nse i may turn all this fat into beef tallow and for that i'm just gonna take that off right there [Music] oh i lost half of it there we go it looks like the fat ratio looks looks pretty good we are gonna give this a re-grind but not before we hit it with uh just a bunch of salt like look at all that salt and an equally disturbing amount of pepper is also going in on this thing and we're gonna surprise everyone with just a little bit of garlic powder you you don't need as much garlic powder as you do the other ones there's no space to mix this i'm gonna get a bowl that and that the longer we wait to throw it back in the grinder the the the the gooier the fat's gonna be and then the rest can be mixed up in the grinder it's it's slipping the angle of it's not so good for this [Music] well all right there it is that's that's our stuffing i'm a sausage girl in a shosh's world stuffed in casing it's amazing that's a bit heavier than normal stop stop in three two one let's share [Music] going low and low and slow on this sausage make sure that it's nice and beefy because we're putting it in the smoker it doesn't need to be so thin the chances of it bursting in the smoker are a lot lower than them bursting in the pan there's no weird ingredient in here to make it first to begin with so these these sausages can be nice and plumpy we'll make some sizeable sausages today that one's looking pretty and then you twist eight sausages you know we probably could have squeezed ten sausages out of this if we really wanted to but you know what part of the fun of making your own sausage is making them different sizes which special thanks to today's mark boxalo box artist this guy oh i like that one it makes him look insane even though mark ruffalo has literally done

i wish i didn't leave my tongs outside as you can see we're bringing some big sausage energy on this one here we go it's smoky it's meaty and most importantly it doesn't taste like a hamburger now would you be able to tell that this is just entirely brisket probably not in fact they kind of almost taste like giant hot dogs sure it may not taste like smoked brisket but at least you've converted your your your scraps into a meal here so i'm gonna have to give the brisket trimming sausage a 4 out of 5. so if you if you want to see that if you want to see the tallow making or if you want to see me making brisket for an nfc you can uh reply so in the comments ",

decided what a great opportunity to have someone else from Cleveland to judge these pork and sauerkraut pierogies my mom hey everybody how you doing Joe are you ready to judge some some pierogies absolutely and exactly when was the last time you were in Cleveland 30 35 years ago can't stay away long enough what a god-awful place anyway we're not here to judge Cleveland we're here to judge these pierogies well now we're dealing with 23 pierogies they're a lot smaller than I thought they would be Michael Simon I mean who knew he was so cheap and there's only three steps so I think what we're gonna have to do is go back upstairs and boil these what do you think of that I think it's a terrific idea okay okay oh my God and wow these pierogies are starting to split open I'm starting to see why he's called former Iron Chef Michael Simon well all right that's that's five minutes on these zombies pierogies option two is to serve with butter and onion and horseradish sour cream on the side which is only available as an add-on and does not come with the 100 order if you had to guess how much half an onion costs and quarter of a cup of sour cream how much does that go for these days 35 cents and Michael Simon's trying to get every bit of it out of me okay looks like it's stuffed with tuna fish what do you think it tastes like tuna fish I don't know I think they're pretty good I don't know if they're worth a hundred dollars but I'll give these pierogies a four out of five okay one solid lump I bet this would have tasted great with sour cream and and the with the horseradish what have you I should I should look up how much extra that is let's find out it's twenty dollars extra look at that smug face he knows he's getting away with murder Cleveland is oh my kind of town show my is Cleveland really as bad as they say it is no we have very few Factory player deaths yeah that's looking like tuna fish ma would you perhaps like to do the honors of counting us down in three two one let's sausage [Music] a little over the top but you know everyone does it differently you crank it and I'll give it a tug am I Cricket at the which one nope nope okay there we go anytime you crank it that's the way you crank it as looks like giant poop oh there's still a lot of pierogies left in there we can't leave them hanging you know I met a guy from Cleveland once really yeah he

  "361": "well hey there folks and welcome back thank you I am one angry potato today this you can clearly see is not pork butt it's pork roast that's not how you make a sausage they were all at a pork butt at the grocery store and they outright refused to go look in the back to see if there was more I know there's not any more in the back you know there's not any more in the back but you still go look just in case I saw this veal breast and I was like well maybe that'll even things out we're gonna blend these two We're Not Gonna use all of it because if this turns out to be a disaster I don't want to throw out all that sausage and it probably will be a disaster knowing this show so this sausage is going to be made entirely of of of MSG you know it would be better if if it was made you know Park but that would that would obviously be helpful to this whole situation the guy just looked at me was like no no we don't have it didn't even handed me there's our veal there's our wrong cut of pork he didn't even say why don't you try our other story The Man hi this this thing needs to be sharpened look how incorrect this park is half of the pork and the other half of the sausages is gonna be the veal really we're halfway to making a bratwurst is there bone this is duller than a butter knife at this point this thing can't even cut refrigerated oh there is bone in there hey if your knife's not sharp why do you keep using it mind your business whatever happened to sorry sir we're all out of pork butt but we're expecting a shipment of Newport but uh on on Tuesday so come back on Tuesday and we'll have your fresh but none of that how dare I the customer ask for something that they sell hey Jimmy you'll never guy asked me if we had park fights I showed him the door and it's not like I went at 12 o'clock at night I went at nine in the morning you know when they stock the shelves but anyway this episode's not called the the gripes with Mr Sausage it's it's we're supposed to be making MSG sausage the best way we know how well not maybe not the best way yeah that thing is jammed with fat we possibly heard in our judgment let's see what all the problem is that would be it let this be a lesson to you to properly have your your your sausage Parts Frozen before you toss them in the grinder otherwise you're going to end up with this well like I I I can tell you one thing about this sausage that the texture is gonna be off it's monosodium glutamate time now I'm not really sure you know how much is is too much here but you know we're we're here to we're here to make something special I should invest in a pair of disposable gloves if you would have called the store ahead of time you would have saved yourself a trip shout out that's enough out of you not gonna call the store for something that they sell on the regular ah yes do you do you sell food at your store you got food there today I mean missing sausage back me up on this I mean I've been telling you to buy it in bulk when you see it in the store buy a month's worth so you don't have to keep going back five times a week so when they don't have it it doesn't matter you don't have to ask run around looking for pork butt you just have the pork butt on hand shout out I mean you've never worked retail no but you have yeah when I worked in the deli we were understaffed and you have people coming to you constantly asking for if you have something in stock you're right it's my fault for questioning the people who work there who are always right about everything it's your fault for not listening to me all right all right dude you want to make this sausage or not no in three two one let's shush [Music] okay ah the perfect amount of casing kids strikes again God it reminds me of the all pork fat sausage get your butt back there and find my pork butt which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy wow back-to-back submissions implying that I do massive amounts of cocaine what kind of Vibes am I giving off I swear it's nothing but coffee and sausages but will it blow you can see how fatty it is based on how it sticks I've always I've always maintained that position so I'm gonna have to give that will a blow three Mark Ruffles here we go these sausages are giving off an unpleasant Aroma they smell like the inside of a Halloween mask all that fat and the sausage dripped out in the pan and kind of messed up our sear here so these are some funky looking sausages but let's open one of these up and see how we did oh it felt behind the table it looks like a fatty one okay here we go um well of course we knew that the texture was going to be all wrong on this sausage and so it is supports extra chewy that that could even be the veal that's causing all that chew who who knows uh taste wise there's nothing Magnificent about this sausage it kind of tastes like we dropped a beef bouillon cube in there that's that's the vibe I'm getting off this sausage really it's not a flavor issue the flavor is kind of it's kind of it's okay there's it's it's nothing spectacular it's the texture that's all wrong uh so had this have been made with with with pork butt and

  "382": "but hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess durian it's the fruit that tastes and smells like feet I'm told this is my first time ever even touching one this one's roughly five pounds and and it costs 35 for it I mean if you can't you keep wrapping up very nice it's it's very spiky and it's uh painful to my hands to hold it it's still partially frozen I hope it's thought enough that we can at least cut through it spikes are going right through me I think I'm gonna need a new knife after this one it's it's slowly cutting open there we go there's the fruit you know maybe you know maybe wait for it to dethaw before you before you try opening up your durian the durian enthusiasts in the comment section are going to tear me a new one it's like opening up an alien egg all right we got our first piece out of there man I thought the gooey duck was Nightmare inducing good Lord that was a workout and there's still seeds in here God what a pain in the butt fruit this is it smells like banana and coconut so I don't know why people say that it smells like feet I don't know it smells pretty good to me let's give it a try I don't know why everyone says this taste bad it tastes like vanilla pudding and feet then we'll just squeeze this seed right out of there there you go there you are there you go that's what 35 dollars of of durian looks like all right well about four cups all right here's hoping we got all the seeds out [Applause] [Music] well that was pointless I gotta say I'm a little disappointed for years all I've heard about is how stinky and bad tasting durian is and this is quite the opposite I was expecting defeat I don't know maybe it's like cilantro where if you got a gene for it it tastes like uh soap mine Immaculate dream made of Sausage King it's sweet enough that I don't think we need to add anything to it I was thinking maybe cinnamon or something but no we're gonna let the natural Taste of the durian shine here whoops oh that's the

halfway done I it seems to be doing pretty good right now so we'll let it ride out the rest of the time well I lied I they swim in the this went for a total of uh two hours well it's super sticky and uh you know it's you know it didn't really firm up but when you we would you would you expect it to I expected it to leak out all the holes so I think this is a win well I guess there's no time like the present to open it up and see how we did it's it's it's gonna be a mushy one durian sausage here we go I'll I'll say this about the durian sausage when you heat up the durian you can taste the feet hold on a second I want to try something I and that's why we don't expose this to high temperatures oh that didn't improve anything even though it's mushy it's like not coming out it's it it stays it stays with the rest of the durian you can't push it out really the casing also doesn't provide a big crunch at all it definitely lost some of that banana and coconut flavor to it and it was replaced by feet I it's not exactly bad it's just unusual it doesn't really work as a dessert sausage so unfortunately I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a two out of five I can't believe we managed to get so much of this durian fruit out of it it's mostly seed and husk ",

but never a rotisserie chicken and especially not one at The Bargain Basement price of five dollars you know for once I'm I'm saying that this is a good deal ah Fit For A King oh the Costco Secrets Finally Revealed and you get a free piece of string with every chicken God the sounds it's making I did chill this in the fridge so that it would be easier to tear all the chicken apart not bad we got I think most of the meat off of these bones and we got a ton of meat to sausage with all right I'm I'm I'm I'm pretty sure we got all the bones out but if not the grinder will sing a different story now that the thought process is that there's enough skin and collagen and general grease to keep this chicken moist I'm I'm hoping the skin is our Saving Grace here foreign T prepared for how much

bloodish spilled in the aisles that's all I'm saying it's like uh it's like Mad Max with shopping carts and you may be saying well that's not Costco's fault isn't it though all right well let's hope that's enough casing because that's a whole lot of chicken well there's there there's no chicken water so that's in this case that's not a very good sign we're up in the dryness level on this quite a bit and three two one and here's another thing about Costco the whole premise is that you buy and bulk to save money but I bought like a tub of toothpaste and and a rotisserie chicken and I walked out of there with you but I'm spending like two hundred dollars that's a thin sausage I think I'm gonna have to grab more casing we're about two-thirds the way done and and we still got a ton of this they're still there's still a little bit left in the canister but I'm not too worried about it it's certainly not the most attractive looking sausage doesn't it look like guts I don't think I'm gonna

in the pan for both of these all right I'll tell you what we'll do this one will go in the pan this one will throw in the toaster oven see which one's better here we go huh give it some breathing room okay yeah this this one's done well it's it's a it's a difference that you can see clearly but is it a difference that you can taste that's that that's what we're gonna find out so uh you know let's let's open them up and see how we did this one of course is the uh uh what this is the one that we baked in the toaster oven I'm in it it doesn't it it doesn't look too dry I guess but we'll see how this one does almost identical all right I'm gonna try this one first because I think that it will taste worse here we go it's it's not bad but the chicken is dry and now we'll try the pan seared surprisingly this isn't as dry they basically taste the same the only difference is is the level of dryness and um the the color even though both Skins are crispy this one looks like it was boiled I'm in a conundrum because on the one hand it tastes better than cat food sausage but it's it's not really better than cat food sausage you don't get that rotisserie taste to it once it's ground up and then cooked again uh so I think I'm gonna have to settle on giving this sausage here on three out of five life also just try getting out of a Costco they got longer lines than Disney World but they have a 12 pound USDA prime brisket for like forty dollars so what am I gonna do ",

sausage I'm looking for and this one ain't gonna be it oh I put the thick tube on this one normally when it comes to bread we don't we don't like thick sausages but I really think low and slow in the toaster oven has been our Saving Grace for a multitude of sausages that's that's the pretzel water in three two one let's Shawshank it's gonna be a tough sausage it's almost like eating the replit Applebee's it's working slowly but surely without all that cheese we would we this thing would not have come out of the tube it's coming over the sides all right I I can't I can't turn it anymore I think we've reached the End by the way if the CEO of Auntie Anne's is watching this and all of a sudden you start selling these pretzel sausages I'm gonna Sue it's so solid I'm afraid to cook it

smells like an Auntie Anne's in there well all right let's open it up and see how we did oh that looks flavorless here we go um we reserve that cheese oh yeah all right here we go again oh yeah that cheese is where it's at we're gonna fix this sausage all right here here we go again well that cheese is this sausage is Saving Grace without it it's pretty plain it kind of it sort of tastes like a pretzel but it mostly tastes like bread and of course we can't forget about the puck ah that puck tastes like a slightly burnt pancake I personally believe that with that we just had the the ratios wrong we should have had more cheese per pretzel bite you know that's on me but you know they they only sell them in packs of six uh so without the cheese this sausage would be like a two out of five with the cheese I'm gonna have to pump that number up to a three and a half out of five this is like a one pop with all that changed now it uh you know that really that really turns this sausage into uh something edible ",

  "414": "well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess today we're making 2x pot roast sausage I had a dream in which we we solved one of this Channel's biggest problems which is turning beef into a sausage that doesn't taste like hamburger there we go so I came up with an idea we're gonna cook half of this pot roast and we're gonna use that as seasoning for the other uncooked half if that makes sense including the vegetables so we'll divvy up the vegetables in half as well and sure it it you may be saying it's probably not a good idea to mix you know raw beef with cooked beef but uh what are you the beef police I mean the the beef should cook down during the cooking process so it's it should this should work I based that on no evidence whatsoever and like with any good pot roast we're gonna we're gonna season it first sear it on all sides and then we'll throw it in the the pressure cooker sit on my cat and we're gonna save the other half for the raw portion foreign we'll let this go for for 30 minutes we'll we'll get this prepared into cubes and and throw it in the freezer for a little bit so that the grinder doesn't get all jammed up with all that hot hot meat this is either the dumbest idea I've ever had or the best idea I've ever had there will be no in between we're looking for a five out of five on this one God this is taking forever all a party well all right it's grinder time then it's time for the raw beef and the raw vegetables what a mess of of deliciousness I am being blocked by a carrot oh oh my God [Music] oh okay oh we're running out of room foreign this hard to believe but this is going exactly as I pictured it this part not so much I'm I I'm I I have I I no longer know what to think about this I wanna take shelter from the poison ring where the sausage has no name no God it's a big boy take a guess what kind of water that is that's the pot roast water and the one let's just say undefined right at the Finish Line you know originally I was gonna pan share this but seeing just how wet it is I I think it's more appropriate that we throw it in the toaster oven Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy oh I got some water on it sorry about that that really does look like Mark Ruffalo this will it Blow is brought to you by raycon does the thought of paying for overpriced earbuds give you instant diarrhea

riding on this one here we go it's pretty good it definitely could use some salt and pepper in there but um it definitely tastes like a pot roast it's holding together but you you can you can see you know you can you can see the texture of that that's that's not it's not great I think we were we were somewhat successful in this it it does not taste anything like a hamburger it is it is 100 pot roast flavor in there just some salt and pepper would probably have cleaned this up quite a bit we are however doing a little bit better than the cat food sausage which which is something so on this

am not a smart man isn't that right Mr Sausage yeah why why did you marry me dead ass dad Ash for all you sausage purists out there I mean we we got it we gotta thicken this thing up I would have loved for this to be a pure fruit tart sausage but when we cut it open I mean it was just gonna leak all over the place but also in the history of this show throwing cornstarch at the at the problem has literally never worked but I got a feeling that this time's the charm oh my God Mirage I'm telling y'all it's Josh it's Josh oh it's already coming out of the tube in terms of good signs that isn't what good God it's so heavy here that I'm used I'm using much casing oh it's almost at the finish line I will never know if there was fruit tart water or not in three two one let's Shawshank yeah oh God I hope that cornstarch Works will be in big trouble if it doesn't oh my God it's making so much sausage it looks like clown intestines you know it's such a high probability of bursting that I think I'm gonna lick these up just so that it if it bursts the whole thing doesn't burst it's it's segmented I'm gonna give it a poke there and a poke there oh heck and one more there we'll see if that does anything hopefully none of them burst but but hopefully the ones that we poke don't burst I mean this this is like it's my confidence is really low about this being successful Which

  "482": "oh my God it's not coming off and we'll just paint over it well hey there folks and welcome back I guess look what Mrs sausage found at the Goodwill guy fet's food cooking it living it loving it if you ask me she overpaid by $22.99 it would have been a better value finding it in the dumpster but irregardless it's the season of turkey and what better way to mess up Thanksgiving than to cook a meal designed by Guy Fetti himself where is it and there we go that's what we're going to be making today oh and only five steps that's a good amount of steps six more is way out of line okay so the first thing that we have to do is prep all this stuff oh jeez none of that none of that stayed on Okay I uh oh wait we we still got to do the turkey cook turkey breast what no wonder why there's only five steps he skipped like half the steps doesn't even say how to season it some salt some pepper and a little garlic are there any other steps that you left out guys Yeti like do I need to Milk The Cow for the cream of course it's going to be only five steps when you don't mention that you got to cook half the food before you start I've been at this for about 30 minutes and we're not even at step one all right start your timers cuz we're ready to finally start we're still on step two doesn't say a single thing about seasoning any of this stuff by the way the only thing that's getting salt is the water I was too lazy to Minch this garlic myself how isn't one and three the same step and step four is to pour tequila around the edge of the pan to deglaze it but it doesn't mention anything about about taking the stuff out of the pan first I'm going to dump it out in this bowl you know what kind of bowl that is and this calls to deglaze with an ounce of tequila which you know I'm no mathematician no one can figure that out then add a half a cup of heavy cream it smells like tequila cooked in heavy cream are we ever going to introduce any spices to this we do need to add the lemon juice and a little bit of cilantro add some salt to it God it's like it's like it's like if Mrs sausage wrote this can you imagine tossing this fetuccini with all that garbage in the pan give it the old parmesan cheese treatment okay so final step is to Nest the pasta on a serving plate slops on everybody and it says to finish it off with some cracked black pepper and lime Wes the freshly cracked black pepper isn't going to save this you know what would I don't know maybe using more more than one spice uh uh looks okay let's give it a little taste test here it's too much black pepper it tastes like someone's uncle was drunk in the kitchen I write the recipe a three out of five but will it taste better in sausage form not at the Finish Line don't do me a don't don't do it at the Finish Line oh that piece of turkey is now floor turkey it kind of just looks like ground turkey wouldn't it be amazing if this turned out well that's me in the corner that's me in the spotlight

  "487": "hey it's me I Tred the things you see and then I let you know if you should buy what he there folks and welcome back I guess what a what a treat for today come get there we go after a very long Hiatus we're finally back with a brand new should you buy It featuring this drio Chef maker drio reached out to me and they said hey you look like you could use a little bit of help cooking and I said that's how you're going to start the meeting stupid childproof bags there we go hold on all right very little if anything is broken use the water tank only when show how how many how many freaking manuals do you want to three manuals how about one oh wow there's a whole thing going on here my God this thing has so many bells and whistles oh there's more stuff we're going to be making food in the drio chef maker and then we're going to compete it against a normal sausage and see which one comes out on top there's so much all right so this goes right okay we finally got it set up with minimal complaints I might add that would have been a bad thing to cook with make sure you get all the plastic and paper out before you start it is a comi air fryer and cooking thing in general so a couple of things you need to know yes they did provide this machine to me for free yes this is a review but it will be an honest review so we're going to use Chef mode because that's like the the dummy mode oh my there's there's plenty of beef options here you know I'm going to go with the filet manang use the grilling rack luckily for me that's already in there I'm myself am more of a medium rare kind of guy and uh we got two options we can either go with a classic steak flavor which only takes 10 to 25 minutes pretty good or SV flavor I'm going to go with the svie flavor because that's what I want to compare it with water required please fill up the tank we're going to do salt little fresh Cracked Pepper and this recipe specifically calls for melted butter that's that's drenched and now we're going to shove this cooking probe right in the center it appears we have 40 minutes for this thing to cook it's done oh it looks SE to action Moment of Truth right here it looks like a perfect medium I think we took it out of the thing too late give it a shot listen folks I've suied a lot of steaks in my day and uh this one beats them all legitimately it tastes better than any steak that I've Su Eed even though this one came out medium and not medium rare I think I think if we took it out as soon as the buzzer went off it would have been fine I forgot that we needed this to sausage later I got to stop eating it you know I I liked how that steak turned out so much that I think we're going to keep the chicken simple too just a little bit of salt pepper and we'll also hit it with the same butter the thickest part they want the thickest part of that chicken oh only 31 minutes for this one wow it's drippy it's a drippy boy perfectly cooked chicken as well next up is salmon salt pepper and this time we'll go with olive oil right there oh this one's the fastest time for Captain salmon not a bad salmon although I will say the steak was my favorite two cups out of that sausage superstar that is what you [Music] are and three two one let's chage oh this this one could have used a little bit of moisture that's all you get from 6 o of chicken 6 oz of salmon and 6 oz of steak that's like what 87 Oz but instead of doing a will it Blow on something that's going to be pretty incredibly difficult to will it Blow I think I'm just going to take what's left of here and uh we'll just shove the rest of it in the sausage here holy cross contamination Batman so we know that the doo can make steak we know it can make chicken we know it can make salmon or some other kind of fish but how well does it make a sausage SC scop oh nope and SCU for you as well it's like a meat rainbow all right and we'll hit it with the same two ingredients pepper and salt we are never ever ever getting back a sausage in three two one let sh it oh that that one goes down a lot smoother this this one is so sticky what special thanks to today's Mark boxo box artist this Sky will it

less dry first one is the one that was cooked already here we go Yama that's oh God it's like saw us that and it it's it's not good it's that's that's like that's like a zero and now for the one that wasn't cooked beforehand so even though this sausage is perfectly cooked the combination of beef salmon and chicken just isn't doing it for me that that's no fault of the doo you got a juicy sausage in there uh it's just that the flavor combinations I chose are are are no good so I would give this sausage here a three out of five perhaps less salmon would help but today's episode's not really about how this sausages taste it's it's about whether or not you should buy it so to recap we have the doo combination air fryer it Cooks steak amazingly it Cooks chicken pretty darn good and the salmon if you wanted to sue via steak without one of these you would need the following a food saver to vacuum seal in your steaks a svie machine and a container with which to put the SV machine inside of even though this is a pretty big ticket item I would say for everything that it does and for how compact it is you should definitely buy [Music] it so much there's so much stuff ah ",
