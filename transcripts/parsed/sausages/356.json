"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess now normally when we do a shosh heavy episode we poke holes in the sausage and we watch all the sauce drain out in the pan today's gonna be different though because i bought a smoker and we're gonna smoke this tabasco sausage we're gonna smoke this tabasco sausage for two hours but of course we're starting with our classic base of of pork bites and then we're just gonna put way too much sauce into it we're putting our meat in the grinder first and then we're gonna cover it in the most delicious of sausage which is actually not true a sweet baby raise is is a more delicious sauce than tabasco and you can put that on my headstone wait should i have used sweet baby rays for this instead of tabasco that probably would have made more sense a barbecue sauce for a smoked sausage probably would have made more sense but we already did a sweet baby ray sausage so you know that's that's the end of that you know who would love to see this mrs sausage hey mrs sausage you want to come down here and see this no all right moving on then [Applause] and there's our beautiful ground sausage or in hurts it's not quite a sausage yet until we add salt oh and and and and plenty plenty of black pepper this is this is going on the smoker so so more black peppers are good and then of course we put the the uh to oh man this is going to take forever we want this to uh to really have that tabasco flavor in it it smells a little spicy in here smells a lot spicy i'm gonna sneeze oh that's gonna sting now that's a spicy a meatball and just a little bit more you're gonna save some of this for the kids ice cream zero calories not bad it's a healthy choice i've seen fire not seen sausage yeah that one's not very good but with the sausage might be better that's a that's a lot of tabasco water where is this water coming from oh my god oh my god little unintended consequences right there in three two one let's just [Music] this is a liquid that's not wanting to come out peacefully it's almost as if the sausage is being cooked by the tabasco sauce well i get i i guess that's it that's it that's a disappointing amount to to come out of there i guess we'll have we'll have enough for two sausages these these are some ugly looking sausages i i don't know i think tabasco may have been the wrong ingredient for this what's special thanks to today's mark box hello box artist barry is down there he's the he's he's the brown girl can you believe the nerve for 11 steps for nachos not 10 not a nice round number like 10. we got him we got him right in the face how's it feel you 11 step a pretty below average blow but we we did manage to to knock them out so i'm gonna have to give that will it blow two mark ruffalos normally we would poke these right about now but we're gonna we're gonna not do that because they're going in the smoker now well we we we we have a bit of a mixed result here on the one hand it looks like they have a ball sack uh and on the other hand they've developed uh some nice some nice smoke color but this is all just i think tabasco and fat drainage let's cut the shacks off i think our sausages were a little too loose we should have just made like one thick one we'll do what we'll do a sausage autopsy on on one of these sausages here we'll cut it it looks okay so you know that's what it looks like on the inside it looks it looks good we place it in our patented hot dog bun that's it's a that's a dry looking sausage well all right here we go i can't break the skin the skin is is as chewy as chewy can be i can't break it this is after me trying to gnaw on the skin for for a good while it tastes like a slim jim and a chorizo but i cannot break into this skin i'm gonna go with tabasco's a bad idea for sausage it's basically an edible you can't penetrate that skin once it's in your mouth the flavor of the meat's good although it's it's a little loose as you can see i i there's something weird going on with tabasco and meat i think it cooks it like lime cooked shrimp so you know the sausage is you know basically it's basically you know not good the smoke combined with the tabasco flavor is great this it's it's it's totally a five out of five flavor combo the rest of this is is like trash flavor-wise it's a five out of five no no no question there texture-wise and everything else wise it's a dump almost a disqualified level sausage just because of how cumbersome it is to eat this thing i have to give this sausage here a one out of five you know when we use the smoker again we'll use an ingredient that's not so gonna ruin the sausage "
