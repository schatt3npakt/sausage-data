"well hey there folks welcome back I guess to another thing here and as you can tell where we're doing we're doing a quarantined sausage made out of Vienna sausages and don't worry folks I know the people in the chat who want me to make a sausage out of sausage I know this one doesn't count also for the people who want me to make a sausage out of an MRE I'm trying my best here they're everywhere it's sold out so hopefully that this is a good meeting of the middle here and we'll show you well one of my favorite snacks when there's literally nothing else to eat and if you if you're not too familiar with the Vienna sausages I'll give you a quick demonstration here they're fully cooked and there they are you you can go ahead and just eat it right out of the can if you want to and it goes pretty good on a cracker you can just kind of mash it in there and there you go you got you got yourself a treat I'm not a fan of hot sauce but you could put mustard on there you could put you know whatever you want you know this this is your sausage you you you do within what's your please and you know sometimes you don't even need to dress it up you could just you could just suck them right down [Music] you don't have to put the cracker through the grinder you know it's just kind of crumbles fairly easily obviously you haven't seen the show before because everything that goes in the sausage goes into the grinder [Music] do a little texture test here make sure that we're making something that can be turned into a sausage and you know what looks like that the crackers you know that they got most of that liquid always going in there it still looks pretty much like a food folks you know yeah yeah a little hot sauce so we got that you know four sausages out of you know four cans of Vienna sausages and that's but that's really good you probably could have used a little bit more filling because he's a limp I guess you'd call them they look pretty close to the cake sausage if you remember that one so I'm gonna keep these linked and hope that that'll protect them from any spillage that we might have right the oil looks pretty hot cross our cross whatever you got across in there let's give this a shot all right you know so far they're holding up pretty good I don't hear anything spilling out oh yeah let's give it a little sausage flip so we know next time not not to do the sausage flip yeah we're not doing to coat over here folks I think I'm gonna have to take this one out early before any more spills out of it we got one sausage cooked out of it showed you know that's a success definitely a failure in this pan but we did get that one winner out of it and that's all we really need on this show so here we go we're gonna we're gonna taste this Vienna sausage sausage yeah here we go zero out of five bop bop-bop-bop so the entire thing just kind of burst on me it really keeps that cat food consistency and it is it is overly salty we just compacted all that salt into it "
