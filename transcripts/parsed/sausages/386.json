"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess figgy pudding we have we have two Brands here neither of which label their product figgy pudding but I believe both technically are still figgy pudding it's got the peel mixed right in there so I I couldn't decide between the two of them so I figured we'd sausage both and it's probably a good thing considering how tiny these things are God God people eat this foreign there we go the second one is almost this Heating and strong oh these you're supposed to heat these and there's the other one beautiful all right well I guess I'll microwave them for three minutes each and and and and then we'll be back down here hear them chiseling well they they certainly seem worse for the wear after that trip in the microwave um we'll give this one a test see how it tastes tastes like hot cinnamon bread and then we'll give this one also a taste and this one tastes like orange bread so between the two of them we have raisin bread and orange bread I don't think orange bread is the thing but that's what it tastes like this one certainly tastes a lot better than this one I think you can see by looks a lot on which one which one's the which ones the flavor King over here but I think by putting them together we we should still manage to get a a pretty pretty good tasting sausage We wish you a Merry Christmas and a non-denominational New Year [Music] oh my God oh my God it's like eating the potato skins from TGI Fridays I think that'll about do it well that certainly looks like a cup of awful Rocking around the Christmas sausage have a happy holiday oh my God that looks awful this was probably invented before desserts were actually invented foreign water we need a scientist to help us figure out how we're producing water out of this in three two one let's Shaw Sage I'm I'm dreaming of a white Duty for Christmas it's it's still warm to the touch it's it's not it's not a pleasant feeling for this one all right that'll about do it how much figgy pudding did we have left ah about one dog turd size in length another Gourmet dish that we can thank the British for [Music] all of their food looks like poop it's insane Which special thanks to today's Mark boxelo box artist this guy this guy's also the front runner for wiping out all the Black Ink in my printer this bullet blow is brought to you by povpn p-o-vpn or private internet access VPN it's my new go-to for when I want to keep what I'm doing on the internet private if you're still browsing the internet without a VPN what are you my grandpa if you care about your privacy at all and don't want your data ending up in the wrong hands then you better start using a VPN whenever you access the internet VPN stands for virtual private Network which uses a secure tunnel from your device to whatever website you may be looking at it's 100 encrypted so not even your internet or data provider can snoop in and sell that information off to the highest bidder turn Pia VPN on once and let it run silently in the background as you look up that weird stuff that you don't want anyone else to know about povpn also bypasses geo-restricted content so finally you can see what British Netflix is all about and with 30 million users it's a VPN you can trust for this holiday season use my special link pavpn.com sausage to get 83 off two years plus four months for free only two dollars and three cents a month it does not blow so I'm gonna have you so I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow zero mark ruffalos oh I mean really name a Duty or sausage than this one low and slow worked so well on that triple Dipper sausage that that I think that we can we we can Master the the figgy pudding too we're gonna do 20 minutes on each side taking into account that it doesn't burst of course here we go there's a little bit of Sizzle well it appears low and slow is not the method for figgy pudding this thing split along the entire line of the sausage there's no way this thing's Gonna Last another 20 minutes I don't know maybe maybe this end can be saved you know what it's stupid to wait another 20 minutes let's just take this out now get off the pan it looks like a poop heart another holiday ruined by British Cuisine if we ignore the other side it looks okay oh okay no more of that good Lord what have we done here we go well shocked it tastes like how it did after it came out of the microwave nothing nothing changed about that once it was put into sausage casing and and gently heat it up it's not solid the skin is not crispy maybe if we could take a bite that's just all casing no it tastes like orange peel and hot sticky bread the casing does nothing for this sausage I'd probably give this sausage like a two out of five but I mean it's it it bursts so much and this casings just doing nothing and unfortunately for Christmas I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a disqualified [Music] thank you "
