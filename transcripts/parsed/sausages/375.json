"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess I really overdid it this time all right so here's the deal Wingstop has 12 different kinds of sandwiches I ordered them all we're gonna sausage them let's see Let's see we got uh original red something or other Saucy Sam less Saucy Sam barbecue maybe whatever this is oh orangey garlic parmesan similar Sam fell on the floor another barbecue maybe endless fall on the floor well we'll also Shopify you know some bungee in there for for more binder Teenage Wasteland this is gonna be a little rough uh we're we're running out of room by the way this also doubles as the vomit bucket for when my kids are sick this probably doesn't need a regrind but I feel like it would be a wasted opportunity if we didn't now I feel like we ended up with more chicken [Applause] my God this is an offensive amount of chicken I only have Shaw's age for you what were we even worried about stop there we go in three two one let's Shawshank foreign [Music] here we go again well as you can see this made a ton of sausage they're made 21 sausages we'll bake these pan sear these and freeze these Which special thanks to today's Mark boxelo box artist this guy oh man this one's chock full of detail listen this thing doesn't have a chance of blowing but I'm gonna give it one heck of a willow throw man look at that that didn't even budge unfortunately I'm gonna have to give the will a blow zero Mark ruffalos but yeah well they throw now that was worth at least two mark ruffalos here we go all right I think we're done here all right first one up is the pan seared sausage let's open it up and see how we did looks very very uh not good pan seared Wingstop chicken what have you here we go the pantsured one's not really a bad sausage it it's flavorful it is mushy I mean you're gonna get that mush factor in there so that's no good uh I can I can't really tell what flavor it is it it tastes a little bit like barbecue it tastes a little bit like a really spicy chicken it's uh it's a little bit salty too there's a a big salt Factor going into that sausage but the pan seared version is getting a three out of five if the baked version does better then we're gonna get we're gonna go with the higher score oh we gotta burst look at all that grease and we can see by this bursty boy it looks shy it looks pretty plain Jane in there yeah yeah big Wingstop sausage here we go major difference between the two sausages baking it provides it with a little bit more uh solidness uh and and and and I guess the longer cook makes the the flavors integrate more because this is one tasty sausage a little barbecue a little spicy very good sausage I would I would give this a 5 out of five if it uh if it was if it was just a little bit less mushy I don't think you got a sausage all 12 of them I mean maybe one spicy one and maybe one barbecue one will probably get you the same way I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a four out of five pop pop quack quack quack "
