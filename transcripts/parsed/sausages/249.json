"we're here folks and uh welcome back i guess all right here we go final episode in this house we're absolutely not using four bags of crickets to make this sausage i'm thinking more along the lines of one bag give it a little taste test here i should have psyched myself up to see this many dead crickets all right well let's let's do an examination shall we and there's the cricket it looks almost exclusively like the pokemon cocoona oh the eyes are still there that's gonna be great when i'm munching down on it all right here we go it doesn't taste like much i think you need more than just one i can see why people feed these to their lizards you know what you know what it kind of tastes like it's kind of like eating sunflower seed shells it's got an earthy flavor and it's it's pleasantly nutty i i would have to agree [Applause] oh oh my god oh it smells like the fish section at petsmart and we're going to include some of the whole pieces to give it to give this sausage some depth i think it would only be right if we added you if we added some hydration to to this walk to this sausage you don't want to dry cricket sausage just the two of us we can make it if we try just the two of us i would say pretty much after the ball episode i became pretty desensitized to most of these sausages i don't know i think i think this could use some more crunch every day it's getting closer that's really uh you know trash pickup already came this week oh man that's the cricket water problems we got some cricket moving in there now all right i gotta admit that the the longer this is going on the harder it is to execute on this sausage so here we go in three two one let chash [Music] come on i know you got some wow this thing really does not want to push out any of the sausage this has been one of the most difficult sausages i got will it blow yeah it doesn't blow zero mark ruffalo here we go oh it's like writhing like a million crickets when you wish upon a star it's like getting a turnout all right let's open it up and see how we did it looks like a lot of crushed up crickets i think the only thing that's going to save this sausage is a king's hawaiian roll the sweetness with the cricketiness here we go the king's hawaiian roll has had zero effect on this it tasted like it tasted like literal i i give this a zero out of five in the strongest possible terms i'm throwing this in the garbage and burning the garbage can uh some cricket sausage zero out of five buh just the two of us just the two of us "
