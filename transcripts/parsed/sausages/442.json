"we're here there folks and uh welcome back I guess all right here's the deal I was watching Google to help me fall asleep last night and he made this monstrosity saying that you could make Smash Burgers out of hot dogs specifically using what he says is the best hot dogs Oscar Meyer which what I've already said that Vienna beef franks are the best hot dogs so we're gonna put this to the test which one's the best Smash Burger and double sausage them we're off to a fantastic start [Applause] it kind of looks like salmon all right so on this side we're gonna do the the Oscar Meyer beef and on this one we're gonna do the Vienna Beef this this is a burger that does not want to stay together really it's an idea flood from the start if you watch the Google video you know that this is actually going exactly to plan oh that was actually almost enough for the whole thing yeah where I will add a little bit more there all right we're gonna start with the with the Oscar Meyer one tastes like salty hot dog mush all right in the Vienna Beef clearly the Vienna Beef is the winner this one actually formed into a Patty sort of this one was just like all water all mushy water with with you know beef in it I would give this one like a half a point and this one I would give like a two out of five don't make your hamburgers out of hot dogs and it's definitely not worth it the real question is should you take a hot dog turn it into a hamburger and then turn that into a sausage I will give Google dish though this sauce is pretty pretty outstanding escaping recreate a place that's my own sausage I try to change it didn't mean that you should get hurt I I forgot I I forgot the lyrics that's the Google water in three two one let's sausage that's all there is just one sausage link four hot dogs and two hamburger buns will yield you one decent side sausage wait special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy look it's Mark Ruffalo and almost convicted human trafficker Andrew Tate thanks thanks guys I I really appreciate that that's that's really nice but uh will it Blow oh we got we got the Spiderman not too much so I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow one mark ruffalos here we go oh no I like burst it oh come on now well let's open it up see how we did oh not bad it looks pretty interesting in there okay here we go um it's actually better than the than the hamburgers it's one messed up sausage now look at that it's it's it's it's it's it's much it it tastes mostly like the burger sauce and it also tastes like hot dog granules I'd say it's probably equal to the cat food sausage so I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a three out of five oh "
