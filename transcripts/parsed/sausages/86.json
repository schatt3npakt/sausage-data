"hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess if we're gonna heat it up later i think it only makes sense to put frozen corn dogs into the grinder now now the question is uh whether or not we can actually uh you know fit a frozen uh corn dog in the grinder let's uh let's go ahead and take a look at the goods see see if we can uh make an assessment that's frozen all right it fits but will it grind oh it's gonna grind just fine jesus that that that's the worst way to do that of course that leaves the problem with the stick that's screw it we'll include this stick too all right let's finish the job [Music] [Applause] oh i don't i don't even think i have to say it i i think you already know what time it is it's regrind time we'll just lovingly just slide it [Music] all around me are familiar faces worn out places worn out faces and i find it kind of funny i find it kind of sad when people run in circles it's a very very sausage world and speaking of which let's shush [Music] will it blow up well up all right then that that was it it came out uh almost in one clean piece uh not a whole lot of splatter but we got a little extra something at the end so so for that will it blow i'm gonna give that uh uh a two mark ruffalos everything in this house smells like hot dogs now can i go back to bed now no will it burst well it looks it looks good we have a a nice color on it i say we open her up and uh and take a look at uh what's cut inside little prick off too well it it it it well it just kind of looks like a hot dog but how does it taste all right let's go ahead and and try this believe it or not i can't taste any of the wood nor can i feel any of the wood uh at all and it has a really good flavor to it as well it doesn't taste weird at all being in this form probably because it it tastes close to it to a hot dog it very much does taste like like like a corn dog so i i'm really happy with this one i i do have to lose uh some points for just you know how mushy it is i'm gonna have to give this one uh uh uh a three out of five come on benjamin don't let me down "
