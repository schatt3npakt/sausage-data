"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess it's taquito day or taquitos with an s and i've been wanting to do these for a while but i've been saving them for a special occasion a few weeks after valentine's day everyone knows that's frozen taquito day let's see what we're dealing with you know that's what they look like there's 20 of these in here frozen beef and corn tortillas there's there's the there's the the the the beautiful there's the taquitos we're not gonna heat these up because the grinder likes it when it's when it's frozen taste the fiesta we're gonna grind these things and and turn it into a sausage uh here we here we go i gotta poop apparently i'm more excited for this than anyone else it's a sausage i got a boat let's let's turn my let's plug in my grinder that's the kind of bend down where you know you're in your 30s [Music] it seems to be working we're not going to heat these up because the grinder likes it when it's when it's frozen but a big log of taquitos should you let them fall the grinder likes it when it's when it's frozen no maybe i don't know what are you the sausage police my dreams are being derailed this thing goes through frozen pork i can't believe taquitos is what a clogged it there we go why is it robbing the grinder likes it when it's when it's frozen no it's got the struggles listen nowhere on the packaging did this say couldn't handle frozen taquitos i think we did it it looks like cat food take a good look at that huh they don't teach you that in sausaging school they probably teach you about spices and proper meat handling we we play fast and loose uh by the sausaging rules and then you lovingly shove it in it smells just like a freshly microwaved plate of taquitos sometimes i like to sit on my hand and let it go numb so that it feels like someone else is screwing this i found that using warm water helps with sliding on the casing this is good this is going to be one of the more difficult ones to sausage in three two one let your said [Music] maybe not because this little guy does not want to cooperate we got about three inches what i tell mrs sausage is three inches sometimes you just gotta work it until it starts getting hard maybe it just compressed it all i don't think this is gonna blow i can't even push it out with my fingers that's how much this won't blow moving on yeah hang on i guess the sound of of sausages to almost ready to be made if only they could have made the fan noisier wait for it to heat to heat up to the right temperature here we go maybe not oh no i started starting to sizzle you know what i wish i had tongs i don't know does it smell any more taquitoy no smells like hot oil and um burning everything's got like a little layer of oil see when the sizzling stops that's when the whirring begins because that's usually when it's gonna burst oh you know what we should have done those uh frozen uh tamales okay i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna call this done it was starting to burn so i took it out of the pan it it looks like a sausage with corn in it but let's open it up and see how we did it's hot in the center so it uh you know it's it's cooked okay here we go i don't want to discount all the work we did today to turn this into a sausage but it just tastes like a taquito in a hot dog bun i'm not sure you need to go through all the extra effort does this improve the taquito in any way no does it take away from the taquino also no it's just a new and interesting way to to appreciate the taquito impress your friends with your your useless culinary abilities to turn food into the exact same thing it was it's a pretty good sausage i'm gonna have to give you don't wanna try this end no i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 4 out of 5. can you put this pan on that brown thing down there the circle i can't really get in here it's like it's a death trap "
