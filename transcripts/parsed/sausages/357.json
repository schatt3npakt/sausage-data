"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess brisket trimmings how how did we end up with brisket trimmings instead of the actual brisket as you know from the previous episode i bought a smoker oh my god and i i its first test run was with a texas style barbecue brisket and if you make a lot of smoked brisket at home or if you've watched a lot of barbecue brisket videos on youtube like i have you know that you end up with just a ton amount of waste there's so much fat every video the guy's like i know this seems wasteful but we're gonna use the trimmings for something else as they throw pounds and pounds of brisket into the garbage but one of the things you can do with brisket trimmings is is to make them into uh into sausages so that's what we're gonna do this isn't one big piece of brisket there's different pieces of brisket in there especially this piece it's still kind of heavily frozen so let's get to the chopping we got a nice fat cap there and we got nice pieces of meat every piece of steak we've tried to do with sausage with it's always ended up tasting like hamburger and just how well did my first time brisket turn out drier than the sahara desert mistakes were made those two sausages dangling in the smoker from last episode that was kind of embarrassing i i figured we you know you put put put a little bit more sausages in there for the visuals this is just the meat part that i scavenged off of the brisket there's still all the fat that i also took off of it this is the bag that's almost entirely fat if the meat part of the brisket didn't have enough fat on it i was gonna use some of this to to even things out we'll just take this end right there wow swinging a mess huh the fat chips a lot easier than it does break and the rest of this i don't know for an nse i may turn all this fat into beef tallow and for that i'm just gonna take that off right there [Music] oh i lost half of it there we go it looks like the fat ratio looks looks pretty good we are gonna give this a re-grind but not before we hit it with uh just a bunch of salt like look at all that salt and an equally disturbing amount of pepper is also going in on this thing and we're gonna surprise everyone with just a little bit of garlic powder you you don't need as much garlic powder as you do the other ones there's no space to mix this i'm gonna get a bowl that and that the longer we wait to throw it back in the grinder the the the the gooier the fat's gonna be and then the rest can be mixed up in the grinder it's it's slipping the angle of it's not so good for this [Music] well all right there it is that's that's our stuffing i'm a sausage girl in a shosh's world stuffed in casing it's amazing that's a bit heavier than normal stop stop in three two one let's share [Music] going low and low and slow on this sausage make sure that it's nice and beefy because we're putting it in the smoker it doesn't need to be so thin the chances of it bursting in the smoker are a lot lower than them bursting in the pan there's no weird ingredient in here to make it first to begin with so these these sausages can be nice and plumpy we'll make some sizeable sausages today that one's looking pretty and then you twist eight sausages you know we probably could have squeezed ten sausages out of this if we really wanted to but you know what part of the fun of making your own sausage is making them different sizes which special thanks to today's mark boxalo box artist this guy oh i like that one it makes him look insane even though mark ruffalo has literally done

pretty good you can see how fatty our mixture is just by how well that's clinging to mr ruffalo's face there i'm gonna have to give that while i blow three mark ruffalos not bad not too bad we we did manage to get a few air pockets in there there that's that's that's a little better they look smoky and delicious how about how about you say we we try one of these uh sausages we're just gonna open up one of these and see how we did well who's hungry because i certainly am i mean you you can see how juicy it still is it's juicy it's hot let's let's let's get it in a bun and give it a try oh how i wish i didn't leave my tongs outside as you can see we're bringing some big sausage energy on this one here we go it's smoky it's meaty and most importantly it doesn't taste like a hamburger now would you be able to tell that this is just entirely brisket probably not in fact they kind of almost taste like giant hot dogs sure it may not taste like smoked brisket but at least you've converted your your your scraps into a meal here so i'm gonna have to give the brisket trimming sausage a 4 out of 5. so if you if you want to see that if you want to see the tallow making or if you want to see me making brisket for an nfc you can uh reply so in the comments "
