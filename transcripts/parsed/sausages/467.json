"we hear that folks and uh welcome back I guess you know we've done a ton of cheese sausages in the past there we go and they never really work out because they become too gooey with cheese and you could say but shouldn't you be using high temperature cheeses for that probably maybe you shouldn't use so much cheese in your sausages also probably but instead of listening to reason we're gonna double down and use a whole bunch of cottage cheese in our sausage it's thick it's creamy it's got carrageenan in it look at it you think other sausage makers run into these kind of problems [Applause] [Music] oh that it's a little Frozen [Applause] this reminds me of the time I went skinny dipping in Puerto Rico I can I can already tell this one's gonna be a good one this could be five out of five territory you gotta believe in yourself it's the remix to ignition sausage fresh out the kitchen Mama rolling that body got every man in here wishing attached the cottage cheese water in three two one let's Shawshank and that does it I mean to eyeball that all the time that that's that's a gift Which special thanks to today's Mark boxelo box artist this guy I see the Mark Ruffalo there but will it blow just a little bit on the edge there there's the rest of it so I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow one mark ruffalo's but uh here we go instead of getting crispy it's it's just getting waterery oh my god oh wow what is that it's still going it's still going I've never seen anything like it it's still going I doubt there will be any cheese left inside of this sauce oh yeah well let's go it's all liquid it's being boiled from the inside everything around it is just burning so I I think I'm just gonna call it well okay let's uh let's open it up and see how we did pretty plain naturally here we go so the good news that the sausage is not gooey the bad news it's it's almost as if there was no cottage cheese in there at all I think it all turned into liquid and boiled right out of the sausage explain that one to me science there's like no trace of it whatsoever it's gone so basically it tastes like a a sausage with salt and pepper in it but not enough salt and pepper all right there's there's some creamy taste to it but but barely so I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a two out of five pop what happens if I it's all liquid I I I've never seen anything like it "
