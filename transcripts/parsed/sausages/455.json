"how dare I how dare I try to think of interesting sausages to make just make it entirely whiskey sausage Mr Sausage you know how hard it is to think of all these sausages to make not hard at all but still nobody's putting their lips on this bottle like straight alcohol and high heat that's it there's gonna be a fire oh no we made a vacuum looks like we're going the old-fashioned way oh well oh God it looks like straight up gasoline it's leaking here we go I guess immediately everyone's suggestions are terrible oh God the grease hole's Catching Fire oh it's going again well judging by the lack of flames I'm I'm guessing it's done did we accomplish our goals technically yes but come on look at this thing here we go no it's exactly like biting into chewy whiskey it burns from how hot it is and it burns from the alcohol this is also what I look like after I've had a few whiskeys so I'm gonna have to give this whiskey monstrosity sausage a zero out of five "
