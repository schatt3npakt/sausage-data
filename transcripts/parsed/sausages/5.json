"okay welcome back a guess was gonna do a pizza for this one but you know we've been having a lot of problems with doughy foods and our sausages causing them to burst and whatnot also I figured I go to the comment section and take some advice from the audience there we'll do a little Totino's pizza rolls so the first thing you need is a dirty pan just like with a steak if you're not using a seasoned cast iron pan that steaks not going to turn out too well put these pizza rolls if you're not using a dirty pan you're missing out on the flavor [Music] okay this is still hot off the presses and you could definitely still feel the heat I think this will make some pretty good sausage here it's not too wet don't think it'll burst because of the nature of the pizza roll itself it's not too doughy all right so we got about three and three and a half sausages out of that that's that's not bad these things they're pretty hard a lot hotter there's now the other sausages I've made let's see how it holds up in the pan the whole house smells like pizza rolls folks I gotta say these are some of the best-looking sausages that's ever been on the show so don't adjust your sets folks these aren't Teresa's these are raw pizza rolls where it touch the pan it actually crisped up pretty heavy about as hard as Tostitos where it didn't touch the pan though it's still soft you could push down on it let's see what it looks like kind of looks like a sweet potatoes all right let's give it a shot so it's it's pretty much flavorless you do get the taste of the breading a lot of the breading it has a good crunch to it much like a good sausage should you don't get too much of the sauce you don't get too much of the pepperoni there's a little bit of heat behind it now the texture is pretty good but I'm still good I'm gonna give this one one out of five bop bop bop bop "
