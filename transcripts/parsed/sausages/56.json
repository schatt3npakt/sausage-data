"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess to another episode we got ourselves some mixed nuts today i don't know how this will turn out it could be it could you know we've been known to come out with some real surprises on this show and besides it's the friday show it's friday everyone it's it's the wacky friday show you know so you know have fun with it and stop telling me to make you know more serious sausages so it's it's that's the mix nuts sausage [Applause] [Music] we'll give it a little regrind i don't i don't know if that was helpful or not but the texture it is it is because there's oil in those nuts it is a little bit wet if we squeeze it together we see that it forms a ball so you know i think there's enough liquid in there i live it's it's the big tubes that give you the most trouble so i do we're gonna cram it i i hope the cooking releases even more oils because if not this is gonna be uh one of the driest sausages uh ever in three two one let's chase you know this is turning out to be a pretty okay looking sausage so you know what what did we really accomplish we we put some nuts in in you know some casing yeah i'm gonna let's you know let's buy into it almost immediately i i know where we're gonna have problems because this thing is solid okay so you know it's mixed nut sausage taste test here we go the hubris the hubris we had surprisingly it's not the worst sausage on the show in fact it's it's kind of pleasant this is too much this is egregious this is an egregious amount to be putting mixed nuts into if they were like little bite-sized pieces i yeah i could i could see that being like a some sort of dessert thing maybe dip it in chocolate or something i don't know uh there's something here i don't know what that something is but this is not a total failure as it is now the surprise factor is gonna give this a one out of five instead of a zero out of five it's a one out of five buh see if they if they're like if they're like this and then you put like a sweet syrup on there or something and they're like little bite-sized things that could totally work "
