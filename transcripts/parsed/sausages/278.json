"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess so so we got we got some bloody merry mix today and that's what we'll be be putting into the sausage anyway so bloody mary mix with extra horseradish although you know we've learned a lot on this show we've learned that if you just introduce liquid into a pork sausage the liquid just spills out into the pan so i got an entire sleeve of saltine crackers to help chop up some of that liquid so it'll so it's bloody it's bloody mary and yeah and cracker it's uh saucy but first things first we gotta cut up that meat one of these days i'm gonna i'm gonna make a clean slice right through that but it's it's frozen it's a little frozen no gravy she ain't what she used to be fat in sausage goes together like fat on a chicago and that's right chicago the runners-up new york and i think this will make a sausage just fine yeah so this sausage is going to be almost entirely flavored by the bloody mary mix but i've learned that you always gotta add just a little bit of salt just to make sure that that sausage flavor really shines yeah that cat looks that looks that looks good you know i probably should have waited until after this thing was ground up you can smell that horseradish coming at you a mile away [Applause] oh i forgot the crackers [Applause] if this sausage is a success i'm gonna call it the toast of the town for once on this show this calls for a regrind [Music] well you see this is why you want your meat entirely frozen otherwise you end up with whatever this is see what she what see what's causing all that drama oh good lord that's uh that's a whole lot of hits in your getty up there yikes does that look traumatizing she was alone cool shawshan a black dress cry what are we feeding these kids in three two one let's just yeah that's the sound of kids jumping and sausages being made you know i think that this sausage here is probably gonna burst so let's let's let's let's even up the odds for ourselves and give uh give ourselves a little extra breathing room with some links so one link and then you just spin it yeah that's probably good will it blow it it came out in several sections uh i'm gonna have to give that will it blow three mark ruffalo's oh that's cleaner gonna get that right out of the pan that's that's a pretty significant whoopsie right there you don't want to use multi-surface cleaner on your pen to lubricate it all right in three wait all right here we go [Music] why is it yellow yeah those those crackers are they're they're doing their job i don't see any leakage oh shoot oh shoot girl girl now [Applause] stand by you i'll stand by you actually i won't because you got to get the heck out of here not another one get out of [Music] [Applause] don't here in the sausage game we're gonna we're gonna call that good enough yep and how are you doing over here you will complete disaster you oh you oh you would you would stick to the pants oh so so that that's what it looks like on the inside you know you work so hard trying to stuff bloody mary mix and crackers inside a sausage casing you you people deserve better wait a second and look as as if that didn't even happen here we go um it's it's it's it's pretty bad it it tastes like bloody mary mix but that doesn't mean it's necessarily a good thing those crackers are certainly shining through though i thought that they would be more neutral well it it it it it tastes like bloody mary mix and crackers but at least the bloody mary mix didn't bleed out into the pan so i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 2 out of 5. well does the kids the kids are home due to remote learning and so we're just gonna have to put up with the footsteps "
