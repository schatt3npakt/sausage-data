"well hey there folks and welcome back to another episode here this is an episode that's very near and dear to my heart the big beef and chatter happens to be my favorite fast food meal of all time so I don't know why we didn't do this one any sooner and will be accompanied by a little a little bit of the french fries because that we knows what happens when we get too many starches in our sausages and we've got some horsey sauce and some Arby's sauce there and we'll be using that as well so it's the Army's big beef and cheddar sausage let's just take a look at what's under the hood here to start off with you got your onion roll here there's the cheese this is what makes the beef and cheddar a beef and cheddar although otherwise you're just eating you know a roast beef sandwich you know you got you got a ton of roast beef and then you have the under the underneath sauce and you know what this isn't your mom's sandwich over here this is this is a big boy sandwich so we're gonna have to cut this up in order to make it fit in the grinder here [Music] well I gotta say folks this this is looking pretty promising over here it looks good it looks like that we got a lot of the roast beef and not so much all that breading it holds a shape pretty well if I clump it together like that it forms a nice shape no III think that bursting will be reasonably low with all of that roast beef that's circulating in here you know and this isn't this isn't in in in any way an attempt for Arby's to send me free food but I will take it if they do send it so there is that I made sure hold are even children get older every night well right in three two one let's shots it yeah I think that already there's no getting around it folks these look like little tarts sausages with pieces of corn in it well all right you know the old expression a hot pan needs a sausage like a hand needs a warm glove so let's go ahead and try this in the comment section everyone wants to blame the casing for the sausages bursting in the pan Bobby and they say things like you know you could poke it with a toothpick or you know maybe try boiling the sausages first the casing isn't the problem here it's the what's going inside of the case is what the problem is I'm feeling pretty bold again let's do that sausage flip on the count of three one two three it's a first-ever sausage flew people you've seen it there first oh well they snuck up on me and these two decided to burst on me so uh the good news is we still have three sausages that made it out perfectly I mean these are perfectly cooked it looked like bratwurst they have a little bit of push to them they're not jiggly at all these are these are the real deal here I I'm excited I can't wait to try it all right you know nothing too spectacular in there all right it's time for the moment of truth here I'm very excited about this one should I try it with a little bit more that Arby's sauce if you haven't noticed I ran out of hot dog buns so that's why we're pouring all these sauces on the same one here oh what a what a plop that one is so this is a little bit disappointing it the flavors fine I mean it tastes like a big beef in shatta maybe not so much the chatter part but you do taste the roast beef however it's a textural loss here it's all just very mushy the pleasure of eating a big beef and cheddar is lost when you put it in a form like this I think what we're trying the future is just try to make the best version that we can make with the ingredients we have so maybe we won't throw the buns in anymore and maybe we won't throw the French fries in there anymore maybe we'll just use primarily the meat and try to make the best tasting sausage based off of that because I'm tired of giving away these low scores here people I want to give away the fours and 5 so this one disappointing I'm gonna give it a 2 out of 5 bop bop bop this how I've been afraid of changing "
