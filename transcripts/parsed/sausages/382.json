"but hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess durian it's the fruit that tastes and smells like feet I'm told this is my first time ever even touching one this one's roughly five pounds and and it costs 35 for it I mean if you can't you keep wrapping up very nice it's it's very spiky and it's uh painful to my hands to hold it it's still partially frozen I hope it's thought enough that we can at least cut through it spikes are going right through me I think I'm gonna need a new knife after this one it's it's slowly cutting open there we go there's the fruit you know maybe you know maybe wait for it to dethaw before you before you try opening up your durian the durian enthusiasts in the comment section are going to tear me a new one it's like opening up an alien egg all right we got our first piece out of there man I thought the gooey duck was Nightmare inducing good Lord that was a workout and there's still seeds in here God what a pain in the butt fruit this is it smells like banana and coconut so I don't know why people say that it smells like feet I don't know it smells pretty good to me let's give it a try I don't know why everyone says this taste bad it tastes like vanilla pudding and feet then we'll just squeeze this seed right out of there there you go there you are there you go that's what 35 dollars of of durian looks like all right well about four cups all right here's hoping we got all the seeds out [Applause] [Music] well that was pointless I gotta say I'm a little disappointed for years all I've heard about is how stinky and bad tasting durian is and this is quite the opposite I was expecting defeat I don't know maybe it's like cilantro where if you got a gene for it it tastes like uh soap mine Immaculate dream made of Sausage King it's sweet enough that I don't think we need to add anything to it I was thinking maybe cinnamon or something but no we're gonna let the natural Taste of the durian shine here whoops oh that's the durian water in three two one let's change [Music] [Music] it's it's still frozen it's like the little sausage that could over here which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy this will it

to give that will it Blow one Mark Ruffalo well all right we're gonna we're gonna be baking this at super low temperatures here we'll put this on for 250 for an hour all right we're a little over halfway done I it seems to be doing pretty good right now so we'll let it ride out the rest of the time well I lied I they swim in the this went for a total of uh two hours well it's super sticky and uh you know it's you know it didn't really firm up but when you we would you would you expect it to I expected it to leak out all the holes so I think this is a win well I guess there's no time like the present to open it up and see how we did it's it's it's gonna be a mushy one durian sausage here we go I'll I'll say this about the durian sausage when you heat up the durian you can taste the feet hold on a second I want to try something I and that's why we don't expose this to high temperatures oh that didn't improve anything even though it's mushy it's like not coming out it's it it stays it stays with the rest of the durian you can't push it out really the casing also doesn't provide a big crunch at all it definitely lost some of that banana and coconut flavor to it and it was replaced by feet I it's not exactly bad it's just unusual it doesn't really work as a dessert sausage so unfortunately I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a two out of five I can't believe we managed to get so much of this durian fruit out of it it's mostly seed and husk "
