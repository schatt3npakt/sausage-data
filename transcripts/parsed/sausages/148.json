"hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess so today we're gonna be making a ratatouille otherwise known as confi baldy well we'll be closely following this recipe i don't i don't know if it'll be exact how good could this be it's just vegetables but here we go we're gonna we're gonna rat this chewy right right now we're ju we're just making the sauce for this thing i don't i don't exactly have a a gas burner here so we're going to have to benny haunter this i don't think my blender is powerful enough to cook this thing but we're certainly going to give it a shot it is not hot now we now we can finally move on to building the damn ratatouille well it's not the prettiest one but once we put it in the grinder it's not gonna make that much difference so let's shove it in the oven all right here we go well there you go it looks exactly the same as when it went in we're gonna be using some chicken breast candles to mold our ratatouille that's part of the magic it's part of it's part of the tui well all right there it is there's the ratatouille that we're now going to just shove right into the grinder yep giddy up cowboy get on in there well there it is it looks exactly like throw up and you know but it it but it it but it tastes like vegetables that have been in the oven you make me feel you make me feel you make me feel like it's stupid it's a stupid dish to call this a dish is stupid if you've ever boiled a piece of chicken before that's way more flavor than you're getting out of this thing if you go back and watch the bimbic episode of this he doesn't say it's any good either all right in three two one let's shush shashage oh we ran out of casing well just as well how much of this sausage can i actually eat will it blow why yes it did blow it it blew very easily i i must say i'm i'm gonna give that to uh three mark ruffalo all right you know what i'm not gonna poke any holes in this cause it's gonna just leak into nothing so we're just gonna have to try to pull this out before it bursts i'm gonna find the writer of ratatouille and punch him right in the in and then we just let it do its thing no we got a burst we got to get this out all right here we well all right here's our soggy ratatouille i guess the only thing left to do is uh to you know try it but first we got some fan mail to open don't act like you've never seen it before a wax stamp when when i can decipher what this says i will read it omega 7 and there it is we got a nice little sausage just dreaming the day away thanks for the daydreaming sausage fan out omega we will put it back under on the wall of ours nice and long that's the way i like them here we go we're gonna we're gonna try this ratatouille shawshank uh actually being in the in the sausage casing and stewing in the sausage caging that completely replaces everything we've said about the ratatouille are you nuts it tastes even more like hot vegetables than it did before zero out of five buh i mean it's good if you're a sad vegetarian but for everyone else you know a little chicken in there maybe some beef that'll go a long way "
