"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess all right place your bets you know i'm guessing that this is gonna be a solid two and then you're gonna make a solid two oh well that's uh that's a little bit of a disappointment i didn't think that this would be so much in a bag let's let's let's take a look at the goods here oh shoot how is this not happening here listen this is the first time i've ever been defeated by packaging dude there's a all right we'll call that good i just tried a piece of it called it and it tastes like medicine and syrup all right we've screwed around long enough so it's the jack daniels pulled pork sausage let's let's let's take some of this and we'll see if turning it into a sausage improves it versus just having it on a sandwich button by itself what the heck happened to the sauce there's the sauce if i don't get some sausage oh yeah i'm gonna fade away in three two one let that's a that's a very odd looking uh sausage i i think that's the best we're gonna do this will it blow is brought to you by expressvpn do you want to get shredded in just 30 days well i don't know how to do that but i do know how to unblock geo-restricted content on netflix expressvpn sticking it to netflix since 2009. here's the deal if you live in the united states you're getting like the most mediocre version of netflix netflix actually has way more content but not for american eyes so as an american what can you do well wipe that gravy from your chin download expressvpn to your phone or computer and click a button can you do that can you click a single button once you press that button expressvpn puts on a fake mustache and tells netflix you aren't an american slob you're an ecuadorian go-getter or a german intellectual i've been using it to watch brooklyn nine-nine by changing my location to canada and i've been saying netflix this whole time but it also unblocks geo-restricted content from other streaming services like amazon prime disney plus and many more find out how you can get three months free by clicking the link in the description box below or go to expressvpn.com and tell them mr sausage sent ya well one mark ruffalo all right i'm not liking how much oil that was all right here we go all right so we we we got our sausage and we and we got our pulled pork but but first things first you know let's let's see let's see how we did it looks like hot and mush in there well okay let's you know here comes the official test first we're gonna try the pulled pork it definitely tastes like a microwave pulled pork but it's it's uh it's a bit on the delicious side i i'd give that like a two and a half out of five no problem and of course now that leads us to this beautiful looking sausage here we go um i don't think that anything was added or lost despite our best efforts it remains a pretty soggy sausage these two taste exactly the same this one's a bit more mushy because it went through a grinder and this one's a little bit chunky because it didn't was anything improved here today no was a lot of time wasted yes so unfortunately i'm going to have to say that this one is the winner so i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a two out of five you know i'm guessing that this is gonna be a challenge too buh "
