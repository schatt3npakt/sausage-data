"well hey there folks andrew welcome back i guess but before we get into what's in this box what secrets are you hiding we gotta talk about what i'm doing up here so dr gottswood is the person who's made my cutting board but anyway he says to me he says i want to see more of that beautiful kitchen of yours so why don't i make this big beautiful wooden thing that sits on top of your burners there and then that way you have more room to do your sausaging there's still very limited space up here dr gotswood but i appreciate the enthusiasm i'll leave a link for dr gotchwood's uh in the link below but anyway it's time to see what's in the box and there it is we we have the the jolly bee chicken joy two-piece fried chicken here and we also have paula buck i hope i'm saying that right because this is the first time that i'm i'm looking at this thing and it appears to be rice noodles ground pork sauce and and shrimp and and this and and hard-boiled eggs it looks tantalizing to say the least and and now we do the drum we're all good on the chicken let's put in this polybuck i hope i'm saying that right please don't correct me in the comments because i will cry well just shove it all into the grinder for a nice even mixture i think it all may just fit in there there it looks that looks hold up that you know give it a little mixy mix here this one's gonna be a good one i can tell those rice noodles maybe it may be the death sentence of this whole thing there that's that's that's looking a whole lot better so what i'm still a sausage in three two one let's just change and that's it with special thanks to today's mark box hello box oh my god good lord it reminds me of that reoccurring nightmare that i keep having so will it blow it's it's everywhere those have got to be rewashed well i have no choice but to give that will it blow five mark ruffalo's that's that's way too much oil and we're gonna test out how good this pan really is so here we go oh no we got a burst okay that's that's enough of this like oh no oh my god i told you i told you it wasn't the pan it's the ingredients inside you hear that ma i was right well it it it still looks you know tasty well well we'll still give it a shot we'll just eat the front end of this okay here we go that is a flavor right there inside of there it almost tastes like fried rice of course the the consistency is is an issue that's you know not very sausage-like nothing nothing held together but man i but that this has got to be one of the best tasting sausages i've made in in at least this year the only problem with it it's just shall fall apart i can't taste the shrimp or hard-boiled eggs but that that was like a very small part of the the the hobble papabak is that what it was paula bock so i'm gonna have to give this sausage here or you know what's what's left of it a 4 out of 5. hold on there's also some gravy that goes with it yep that gravy's delightful that's a 5 out of 5.
