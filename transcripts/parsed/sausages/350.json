"we're here there folks and uh welcome back I guess really what I want to do is is make the sausage and squeeze this into the sausage like a donut I don't know how well this thing's under pressure it might work if I try to Center the cheese inside of the sausage mixture it's gonna get screwed up when it comes out of the extruder weird things happen inside of here foreign [Applause] I think I'm out of pepper give it a quick mix here some people wait a lifetime for a short shoot ings in three two one let's Shaw shut up and that's it that was that was all the sausage that was made that looks like one sausage length all right we have our three sausages here three attempts to get this wrong we're gonna make a haul let's give it the old insertion get back in there chase you don't belong on the outside hold on we're gonna attack it from the other angle okay that's that's jam-packed down all right at least both ends got the cheese in it I'm hoping some of it traverses into the middle of the pack this one I'm gonna do side entry and this one I'm Gonna Leave playing just to see how it is which special Smart Box hello box artist this guy this is more this is more Mr Sausage box art unless this guy's Mark boxelo and he's having quite a time in the background so will it blow well Spider-Man's catching it right across the face the Box remains dry so I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow one mark ruffalo's Boop well all right here we go I almost forgot our will it blow this this pan is nothing but chaos what what what what what what exactly have we accomplished today let's start opening them up and seeing how we did all right well the one with nothing inside of it gets it you know it's it's done it tastes like a like a like a normal sausage as it should there's just salt and pepper in there all right this is the front and unloaded one and as you can see the size has decreased by a lot so let's see if we actually got some cheese in the center there none whatsoever I think it all Spilled Out the sides and closed and now for the side loaded one it had cheese coming in and out of it from every which way you can think of and it's still raw there's cheese inside of here I guess that once the meat solidifies it it expels the cheese from within ah that that had a little bit of cheese inside of it I I will take a bite of that as well well what can I say this this was a total failure if the cheese didn't cook out of the sausage it it made the sausage not even done yet I get I guess that would mean it's a bad idea to make a sausage you know with a a a cheese corn inside of it a flavor wise you know it's it's not it's not it's not better than the powdered cheese sausage we'll have to we'll we'll have to go back to the drawing board on this one so I'm gonna have to give spray cheese sausage a two out of five pop "
