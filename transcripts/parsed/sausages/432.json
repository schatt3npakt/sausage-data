"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess today we're gonna make Italian sausage stuffed crust pizza we're probably gonna burn this pizza but that's okay it's it's more about the sausage inside of the pizza than the than the pizza itself so let's just jump right into it here we have our our our half thawed half frozen pork bite [Music] oh so to make this Italian sausage we're gonna need salt and pepper we don't we don't measure on this show we we measure by feeling onion powder and garlic powder a little bit of time a little bit of rosemary parsley flakes oregano crushed red pepper flakes it's for the Spice basil and fennel seeds get it all in there get those fennel seeds all up in there oh it smells like an Italian sausage already which I guess technically it is carry on my sausage [Music] so here's what we're gonna do we're gonna make this sausage we're gonna cook it and we're gonna encircle the pizza with the sausage to make our stuff crust that's the Italian sausage water in three CDC Doocy let's sausage pull your thick You're A thick one Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy he's made a pork butt and ground pork and and slices of of ham sausage eyebrows I don't even know what that nose is made of but will it blow it blew right on the floor so I'm gonna have to give that will it blow half a Ruffalo Peach now the pizza oven is so hot that it can cook this pizza in like 60 seconds so we're so we're gonna cook the sausage first then we're gonna add it to the pizza here we go oh let's make this pizza [Music] sausage right there it's gonna be a little pizza that's okay give it some sauce give it a little bit of Parmesan there yeah give it give it give it some mozzarella there and finish it off with a little bit of pepperoni it's ready well oops that's gonna be an oopsie for me man is that ugly well at least the sausage isn't burned so let's give it a taste test the pizza side is cooked perfectly now now for the now for the sausage side of things [Music] uh the good news is it's it's just the very outer layer that's burned so I mean the inside's not burnt so you can barely taste that burnt flavor you know the sausage itself is great it tastes like an Italian sausage I think I think where we went wrong is that we made it just way too thick we should have used smaller casing for this and and May and and not made the height so so big I think that's where we went wrong so we're gonna have to try this one again in the future and make the sausage quite a bit smaller it's great pizza despite the top layer being burned yeah I mean it's good that's good you don't taste the burn you taste the sausage so I'm gonna have to give our Italian sausage stuffed pizza here a four out of five you're probably gonna burn this pizza we're probably gonna burn this pizza we're probably gonna burn this pizza we're probably gonna burn this pizza "
