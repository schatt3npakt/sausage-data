"I think we're soon to see something happen this one's definitely a lot juicier hey there folks we're back by popular demand another ordinary sausage video last time we did a fast food item we did the Big Mac and I figured we'd switch it up a home meal classic spaghetti and meatballs so spaghetti and meatball sausage finish it up with some cheese there I came have enough more is less I always say okay that's looking that's looking pretty good to me and I think I take his time well we'll go ahead and put this into the grinder there go it right on in [Music] all the way things just kind of get it down in there I think what's then to see something happen definitely a lot juice here we go there's to be working just find a will go there if you go first [Applause] okay we got the ground spaghetti and meatballs in there with a marinara sauce the texturally it's it's a bit wet probably from the noodles holding all that water in and I'm sure the marinara sauce isn't helping I'm a little nervous with this one I think I think the casing is gonna burst because of all the wetness but you know but we're gonna give it a shot you know Cece what it how it turns out there okay so now we're gonna put it into the sausage maker there this is a big old lump there it goes dad that looks that looks pretty good to me it kind of looks like something that you'd eat see what it can do so far so good there I think we'll call that number one they say to make hay while the Sun shines so we're gonna keep this going okay I think these these came out looking pretty good I do have a concern with this one the end is pretty pretty wide open there I think it's gonna have the contents of it spill out and up Han is nice and hot I think I think it's time that we cook these put these up and see how they taste yeah see which one of these make it out alive well you know that they're hanging on they're hanging on in there against all odds they haven't quite exploded we definitely have some winners and losers than this one ladies and gentlemen bigger ones we're definitely not not so good for sausage making too much for us to handle okay and as you can see I dressed up one of them in marinara sauce there and also gave it a generous dusting of parmesan and you know it's just in case that the the one on the right doesn't turn out well we got we got something interesting to fall back on so let's give it a shot it definitely tastes like spaghetti and not so much getting the hint of the meatballs that that's kind of that's kind of a letdown I really expected that meatball flavor to come through but let's try this one now that's what that's what you're looking for ladies and gentlemen it's kind of like a parmesan chicken parmesan I had to give an overall rating I I would give this a 2 out of 5 sausages bop bop bop "
