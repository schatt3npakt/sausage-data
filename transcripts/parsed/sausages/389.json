"we're gonna start the new year off by doing easily the most requested sausage for almost three years running cat food sausage it's got the meat byproducts you know in the water sufficient for processing this is my gift to you because I really do not want to do this I I would comment on the smell but I feed my cats this twice a day so I'm used to it oh shoot that one looks a little better look at the juice that's probably enough in all honesty I had to wait until Mrs sausage left the house to record this one but when she comes back she's in for a rude awakening oh my God instant regrets let and my suffering ouch now that's a big pouch of juice looks like a giant earthworm but will it blow uh yeah a little bit that's a three Mark Ruffalo will it Blow here we go oh that seemed too hot here we go again it's actually smelling pretty good it smells like liverwurst which when you think about it isn't liverwurst just cat food for people why did I make it so big there we go it looks like a it looks like the Santa sausage on Earth okay here we go okay a couple of things this is not bad at all it tastes exactly like liverwurst if it wasn't for everything else it would be like a 5 out of five sausage the skin looks like what we unsheet from the gooey duck sausage and the texture ain't any better than that I had to really try to break through that skin I'm gonna deduct it a point for the skin I'm gonna deduct it a point for it not coming together at all but surprisingly I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a three out of five pop "
