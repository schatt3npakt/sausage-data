"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess Chili's triple Dipper appetizer right off the bat let me just say I have some complaints this appetizer costs more than than the entrees this was 16 all of the sauce has has dripped off of the the boneless chicken I mean like how much sauce did they even use not that much sixteen dollars for this with a with with a generous helping of ranch dressing I don't know who they fit why why why why do this well what we don't give you in food we make up for in ranch dressing We're not gonna be using the ranch dressing for the sausage because then it'll all just taste like ranch dressing sixteen dollars for an appetizer that has four items I'm not counting each one of these as a chicken strip this is like one chicken strip that they cut up into five pieces there's the Southwest egg rolls I'm surprised they didn't just cut one up into four pieces and say here what a value you're getting well that doesn't look like death Chili's corporate who are you fooling it's like they didn't even cover the chicken with sauce it's like they squirted it on the bottom sure you think I broke so fast that that all the sauce fell off the chicken well you sometimes don't slow down to the last minute think Mrs sausage [Music] they saw me coming a mile away they got the order for the Triple Dipper and they called corporate and said we got another sucker [Music] look at this burger cost more than my wedding ring [Applause] it's re-grime time [Music] hey yo listen what I shall foreign [Music] let's gouge our customers and now a special message from Chili's corporate we are Crooks this has been a special message from Chili's corporate all right that made a large ropa sausage it's marked boxelo box artist this guy now listen this has no chance whatsoever of blowing but I'm gonna give it my all anyway nothing push it out give it some help we got a head start let's try it now all right so I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow one mark ruffalo's we're gonna go so low and so slow on Dish we're we're gonna wonder if the sausages are even cooking okay the Pan's at 160 degrees and we're gonna cook this for like 20 minutes on each side here we go I can't even hear essential all right that's 20 minutes on one side let's see how it uh how it looks oh yeah it's coming along all right and another 20 I think we'll be done finally some good news on this show we got a sausage that didn't burst and with a total cook time of 40 minutes I think that we have finally mastered the pan so let's open it up and see how we did it looks like the inside of the egg roll and it looks dry so I have a feeling that ranch dressing is about to come back into play all right first without the ranch dressing here we go it's actually not dry at all it's it's it's it's surprisingly very good I I have to admit it's a pro it's really good now we're gonna give it a little bit of a Ranch here we go again I gotta admit this triple Dipper sausage is is is is is is fantastic you can taste the hamburger and the cheese you can taste the buffalo chicken you can taste the Southwest egg roll you know it's not mushy it's a solid sausage the Skin's crispy I think it's fine without the ranch dressing I'm still not going to apologize to Chili's because his price point is is outrageous I'm still gonna give their triple Dipper sausage oh five a five Papa this should cost a dollar this should cost a dollar and the the two bucks for the egg rolls so really it's four dollars if they want to make a profit they double the price so 7.99 8.99 Max for this "
