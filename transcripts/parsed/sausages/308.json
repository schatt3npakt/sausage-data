"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess one of the one of the stinkiest cheeses uh known to man the limburger cheese i've never actually had any i've only i've only ever heard about it from cartoons this used to be the standard and stinkiness uh you know when i was a kid how the heck do you open this thing i'm just gonna i'm just gonna tear it so far it doesn't it i can't smell it from here so it can't be that bad oh my god it does stink this is this is the stinkiest cheese uh that i've ever smelled in my whole life it smells like like sweaty socks old sweaty socks and we're gonna make sausage out of it there you go okay oh my god my hands stink this cheese stinks here we'll give it a little taste test and it it tastes pretty much how it smells well that that doesn't bode well for this sausage but we you know where we've gone this far this this entire block may be a little overpowering so i'm gonna give it i'm gonna give it half a little more than half the the limb burger let's see if that's enough sticky cheese for this this sausage here uh yeah that's that's that's probably that you know uh oh yeah i'd say that looks that looks like a good amount of of cheese to meat uh ratio all right this is going to go in the freezer for 30 minutes oh come on get your frozen meat i i don't want to overpower the cheese flavor with a bunch of spices so we're just going to hit this with a little bit of salt and black pepper i can feel how much that how much this is seizing so we're going to put a little bit of water in this to make sure that it comes out of the tube okay there we go now now we got a meat spin but then i saw her sausage now i'm a believer in three two one let chash and there we have it will it blow i uh we itch a little a little bit it it we got a little bit i'm gonna have to give that will it blow two mark ruffalos okay here we go oh my god it burst already it looks like it's got a serious venereal disease going on right now we're just gonna blow this stink away that's what we're gonna do it just keeps it keeps getting worse there's no reason to uh disqualify this sausage we got we got most of a sausage here i bet this sausage tastes as as good as it looks let's give it a trim and uh uh uh yeah so so there it is it doesn't look very cheesy actually well all right here we go i'll tell you what don't don't judge a sausage before it's cooked because the same thing happened with the vegemite disgusting on its own but mixed in with the sausage it makes a great sausage this is a great sausage here that the the the the taste of the feet i don't know it just it just works wonders on this sausage pretty much a disaster in every other sense so we'll you know dock at a point for that um i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 4 out of 5. well this this is this is tragic who would have guessed "
