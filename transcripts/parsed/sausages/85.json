"hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess to another episode of the sausagers quest today we're doing we're doing surf and turf not only are we doing with the fillets which is totally unnecessary but we're also using sea scallops which are basically like snot to begin with so this whole endeavor may be a huge waste of time however in the quest for sausage we we we do what we must it's the surf and turf sausage gotta season the hell out of it oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] ah you already know what time it is it's regrind time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and we set and we salvage just enough to make a little sausage so let's let's give it the same kind of treatment here well it's a little bit uh rarer than i normally like it but uh you know we're just gonna chuck it in the grinder if you want to call me shawshedge just go ahead now and here comes the backup brigade yeah right out there one big chunk it gets so tangled when they pack it i have no idea why they pack it this way we got a winner this is a this is a big boy this is a long one in three two one let shh yeah all right we gotta do a little a little surgery a little sausage surgery everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong during this filming and we've reached the end of our sausage filling will it blow that was an awful will it blows yeah we got it out of there but not much really happened there i'm gonna give that willa blow one mark ruffalos will they burst oh geez that that's the worst entry into this thing we gotta redo that good there there you go enjoy water from the scallops is pouring out of the oil and onto the pan and it's kind of cool in the pan so that the sausages don't get too hot so we have about half a half a half a sausage here all right let's try this cooked one it tastes like ground beef with a little bit of fish that's getting a one out of five hopefully this one does a whole lot better that's a pro sausages move don't try that one at home it looks to be a complete uh sausage so you know let's let's let's go for it this one's the opposite this one's mostly fishy with a little bit of ground beef it does not help it so because the uh uh water kept pouring out it got instead of like searing it it kind of steamed and seared it so it's not very crunchy at all it's as if we boiled it that's that that's kind of the texture of the uh uh sausage casing i'm giving i'm giving uh the raw the one we didn't even try and the cooked sausage wherever that may be in the garbage a 1 out of 5. mrs sausage is eating this mrs sausage what are you giving this um i give it a four i give this a a a a four out of five "
