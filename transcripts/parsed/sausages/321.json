"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess we had a bit of a revelation uh a few episodes ago when we found out that soup mix could could be used to season sausages actually it was a vegetable mix dip but it's the same premise and truth be told i i have done a ramen sausage for a patron only live stream so all things considered it wasn't too bad this is a this is a zero but we're gonna see how this ramen does raw there was probably a better way to do this than hitting it with a wrench we got our nice and frozen pork butt here man is that frozen nothing a little elbow grease can't take care of add the flavoring to it we'll open up one more give it a a nice sausage uh ramen pour there i mean i i don't know if that looks good but it certainly looks uh interesting thursday i don't care about you but friday i'm in love with sausages this is this one's gonna be a difficult one may i help you with your coat all right in three what two one let shawshank and that's all she wrote the casing psychic over here and special thanks to today's mark boxalo box artist this guy i i'm thinking mark ruffalo looks good with you know a few extra pounds of meat on his bones so will it blow it it does not blow yeah i'm gonna have to give that will it blow zero mark ruffalo i want a new pan one that won't make me stick here we go all right i'm i'm thinking that's that's about done well all right let's let's let's open this up and see how we did it appears to be a sausage there's those noodles they they look like little maggots here we go it tastes like lipton's cuppa soup the the noodles did not stay crunchy they they they got cooked in the in in in the fat it's not as good as the vegetable mix i can tell you that much it tastes like there's some of its parts it tastes like sausage and it also tastes like 36 cent soup mix i thought it would be better i thought that this would be at least a four out of five it doesn't really deliver a wow factor to it it just it just kind of tastes like a cheap soup mix and and sausage so i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 3 out of 5. oh yeah yeah when in doubt use your hands that's that's my new saying "
