"welcome back I guess to another episode we got a big one today we're doing the 12-pack 12-pack Taco Bell box they are they are all are we're working on wrap these things and then we'll get to the sausages so you get you got your lettuce and your beef and your cheese what else what else you need all right so we're gonna run a little experiment here this one we're gonna put in the grinder but for these we're going to put them straight in the sausage maker and see how they turn out since most of the pieces are already ground up to begin with [Music] [Applause] I think we're gonna have some pretty good sausage meat here I mean it's essentially just ground beef with some taco shells in it okay we've got some residual sausage meat in there but I think it'll be okay I think it did a pretty good job getting most of that out of there yeah juices that were squeezed out of the top of that so there's a pretty big difference between first grinding your Taco Bell tacos and not as you can see these are a bit uglier the ones that went in whole the pieces are more defined in there whereas ground this could be really any kind of sausage it before you bite into it it looks pretty good for tacos at the end of the day it's not how they look it's how they taste ground sausage do another one just for safe measure here we are getting some spillage both in the ground meat or ground taco but we're also getting some spillage in where we didn't grind it up so it appears to not that not have too much of an effect on whether or not they'll explode or not yeah cut it open see what it looks like so it looks like that we keep Laura the taco shell as to be expected I mean it's not ground-up or anything so there it is okay so I think the the most grating ways to eat these in a tortilla uh-huh and so right now we'll try the ground sausage first not much of a crunch it does taste like a Taco Bell it's a pretty pretty mushy Taco Bell tasting sausage now let's see if there's any difference with one we threw in whole there's definitely more texture with the one we threw in whole makes it just a little bit better if I had to grade these uh it's not worth the time I give this a 1 out of 5 sausages I don't think we invented a new menu item today no but we tried so that's the most important thing we we gave it a shot it didn't work out this time but there's always next time bop bop bop "
