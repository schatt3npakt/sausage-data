"we're here there folks and uh welcome back I guess now typically I would already have this out of the bag and ready to go however I want to play a new game called how it looks on the website versus how it looks in the to-go order and as you can imagine I've already seen what this to go order looks like so so here's what it looks like on the website all right looks looks pretty good looks pretty tasty right but here's what it looks like in the to-go order and there it is so apart from having three times the amount of pasta that that they show on the website they they didn't have a box that was big enough to to fit the chicken parmesan style pizza so what they ended up doing was uh cutting it in half and placing half of it on the other half I'm like a magnet for for to-go orders to go wrong so right off the bat you know you're in trouble when they don't have the the size box to go big enough this can't be a satisfactory boxing for for a Cheesecake Factory could it it's only been 15 minutes since I picked it up this is not pizza this is not dough this is chicken breast that's been coated in in in in in in in something and then a generous lumping of angel hair pasta in in a white sauce and at 19 I think you can agree this is probably not worth the price point we're here to make this better by turning it into a sausage oh that was a good first strike those are rare I will say this it is a lot of food a molar the amount of pasta chicken ratio is is certainly off I I think that this thing's gonna have to be baked All I Wanna Do Is sausage fun I got a feeling I'm not the only one whoa that's still whatever the heck this thing is called water and now a special message from Cheesecake Factory corporate our customers are fools this has been a special message from Cheesecake Factory corporate in three two one let's Shaw shed and that is about it we're gonna link them but make them long and thin uh so we got six sausages out of that pretty good chai sausages too so uh you know not bad Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy I don't get it shall will it blow of of a a very very tiny amount I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow one Mark ruffalos God look how greasy my fingers are all right we're gonna go 275 for a full hour oh I hit the rim of the shoot we're almost about halfway through and uh things are looking pretty good that's usually what I say right before I come back down and they're all burst but uh we're gonna go for the other half hour anyway all right that's the full hour and it seems oh all the great oh all the gracious part no no no no no no uh but as I was saying it looks like we have a few bursts it looks like at least half of them burst on me God what an amazing amount of oil that came out of these things so it appears that these three in the middle burst so a fifty percent burst rate which surprisingly we consider a success on this channel but uh let's go ahead open one up and see how we did it looks delightful oh gosh excuse me here we go there's there's not a whole lot to say about this sausage other than it tastes exactly like the pizza roll sausage it's it's on its way to getting solid but it's you can see how how mushy it is in the center what another hour fix it probably not I wouldn't waste 20 bucks on this thing so so so so not so not very good eating I just looked it up in the sausage database.com and the pizza roll sausage got a one out of five and I think that's an equally good score to give this sausage so I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a one out of five pop up until the sun comes up over sausage Monica Boulevard [Music] "
