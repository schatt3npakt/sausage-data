"hey it's me I Tred the things you see and then I let you know if you should buy what he there folks and welcome back I guess what a what a treat for today come get there we go after a very long Hiatus we're finally back with a brand new should you buy It featuring this drio Chef maker drio reached out to me and they said hey you look like you could use a little bit of help cooking and I said that's how you're going to start the meeting stupid childproof bags there we go hold on all right very little if anything is broken use the water tank only when show how how many how many freaking manuals do you want to three manuals how about one oh wow there's a whole thing going on here my God this thing has so many bells and whistles oh there's more stuff we're going to be making food in the drio chef maker and then we're going to compete it against a normal sausage and see which one comes out on top there's so much all right so this goes right okay we finally got it set up with minimal complaints I might add that would have been a bad thing to cook with make sure you get all the plastic and paper out before you start it is a comi air fryer and cooking thing in general so a couple of things you need to know yes they did provide this machine to me for free yes this is a review but it will be an honest review so we're going to use Chef mode because that's like the the dummy mode oh my there's there's plenty of beef options here you know I'm going to go with the filet manang use the grilling rack luckily for me that's already in there I'm myself am more of a medium rare kind of guy and uh we got two options we can either go with a classic steak flavor which only takes 10 to 25 minutes pretty good or SV flavor I'm going to go with the svie flavor because that's what I want to compare it with water required please fill up the tank we're going to do salt little fresh Cracked Pepper and this recipe specifically calls for melted butter that's that's drenched and now we're going to shove this cooking probe right in the center it appears we have 40 minutes for this thing to cook it's done oh it looks SE to action Moment of Truth right here it looks like a perfect medium I think we took it out of the thing too late give it a shot listen folks I've suied a lot of steaks in my day and uh this one beats them all legitimately it tastes better than any steak that I've Su Eed even though this one came out medium and not medium rare I think I think if we took it out as soon as the buzzer went off it would have been fine I forgot that we needed this to sausage later I got to stop eating it you know I I liked how that steak turned out so much that I think we're going to keep the chicken simple too just a little bit of salt pepper and we'll also hit it with the same butter the thickest part they want the thickest part of that chicken oh only 31 minutes for this one wow it's drippy it's a drippy boy perfectly cooked chicken as well next up is salmon salt pepper and this time we'll go with olive oil right there oh this one's the fastest time for Captain salmon not a bad salmon although I will say the steak was my favorite two cups out of that sausage superstar that is what you [Music] are and three two one let's chage oh this this one could have used a little bit of moisture that's all you get from 6 o of chicken 6 oz of salmon and 6 oz of steak that's like what 87 Oz but instead of doing a will it Blow on something that's going to be pretty incredibly difficult to will it Blow I think I'm just going to take what's left of here and uh we'll just shove the rest of it in the sausage here holy cross contamination Batman so we know that the doo can make steak we know it can make chicken we know it can make salmon or some other kind of fish but how well does it make a sausage SC scop oh nope and SCU for you as well it's like a meat rainbow all right and we'll hit it with the same two ingredients pepper and salt we are never ever ever getting back a sausage in three two one let sh it oh that that one goes down a lot smoother this this one is so sticky what special thanks to today's Mark boxo box artist this Sky will it

thickest part of the sausage all right so we have our unorthodox sausages ready to go there's no sausage setting on this thing you know probably not 130 chicken I think needs to be you know at least 160 all right now we wait that's incredible this took 10 minutes but uh let's open it up see how we did first off the one that was cooked already that looks pretty dry and this one looks a little bit less dry first one is the one that was cooked already here we go Yama that's oh God it's like saw us that and it it's it's not good it's that's that's like that's like a zero and now for the one that wasn't cooked beforehand so even though this sausage is perfectly cooked the combination of beef salmon and chicken just isn't doing it for me that that's no fault of the doo you got a juicy sausage in there uh it's just that the flavor combinations I chose are are are no good so I would give this sausage here a three out of five perhaps less salmon would help but today's episode's not really about how this sausages taste it's it's about whether or not you should buy it so to recap we have the doo combination air fryer it Cooks steak amazingly it Cooks chicken pretty darn good and the salmon if you wanted to sue via steak without one of these you would need the following a food saver to vacuum seal in your steaks a svie machine and a container with which to put the SV machine inside of even though this is a pretty big ticket item I would say for everything that it does and for how compact it is you should definitely buy [Music] it so much there's so much stuff ah "
