"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess now the last time we made a somewhat traditional sausage we didn't we didn't treat the meat properly this is the original meat spin so before i started this episode i did a little prep work and i got the meat all nice and cut up and i stuck it in the freezer for about 30 minutes so that it's nice and firm so let's take a look at the goods the package is two and a half pounds of pork butt but we're only going to use half of that and likewise with the bacon we're using half the bacon so the first thing we're going to do is grind our meat then add spices and then regrind it [Applause] [Applause] i'm thinking i'm feeling that christmas spirit chestnuts roasting on an open fire a jack of frost nipping at your nose yeah garlic powder onion powder high end pepper pepper and salt give it the mix it deserves use your hands people there's nothing to fear okay now that's ready for a second grind what are you nuts we gotta put the candy canes in first like like seven to ten candy canes fold it in fold that right on it there they're in there but but i can't see them i i guess we're gonna need a few more candy canes to even this out there then now it looks right remember to use those hands beautiful just not roasting oh god all right in three two one let's josh ho ho ho well i i certainly hope this turns out to be a good sausage

you a size that you're used to oh perfect oh my god it's got enough it's like it's juicy it's juicy from the bacon it's got a little bit of heat from the from the red pepper we used but it's also got that sweet peppermint taste it's not overpowering it's a little bit of a peppermint aftertaste what's the sauce there's the sauces from the sugar from the candy cane melting i'm on the fence i i'm
