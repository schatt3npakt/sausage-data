"hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess so as we know from history steak boiled in liquid smoke is it isn't so good as I remember it it made it taste like a cigarette salad so uh you know maybe we won't uh use the entire bottle Dash a brush on steaks oh a brush of it well that's probably where we went wrong this has been in the Deep Freeze for months and now we'll just break it apart oh this isn't going to be so easy it's it's working as well as it isn't hold on I have a tool for such a case it's harder to break than concrete hey Frankie this guy doesn't want to give us the money all right we're gonna consider this good enough oh my Liquid Smoke all right well the first thing we're gonna do is is grind this up into even smaller bits [Music] my my grinder struggling with frozen pork in terms of good signs that isn't thank you suck there we go and backed by popular demand is the vomit bucket vomit bucket you're the one you make sausages lots of fun all right don't you worry your little socks off because we're definitely gonna give this a regrind but first we're gonna hit it with a little salt a little bit of well maybe a lot of pepper get out of the pepper box get out of the pepper box onion powder garlic powder paprika now that's a smell that brings back some memories why is it foamy a brush of it would be like that that much my house stunned for like eight days after the the original boiling of the liquid smoke this better not be a repeat back in the grinder we go well it's it it it sort of smells like uh you know pepperoni and um cigarette salad I need a sausage I'm holding up for the sausage till the morning light foreign now I know that water is just from the pork thawing out in the in the in the sausage tube and through and through fine let's just look at this look at this look what I'm doing here all right we're going to link these as we go along and you may be saying but Mr Sausage those are some pretty plump looking sausages but that's because I like my sausages like I like my women smelling like pepperoni and cigarette Ash Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy not even close sorry my friend but not as sorry as I would be if you didn't waste all the red ink in my printer so I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow zero mark ruffalos all right we got we got some plumpy boys here so we're gonna we're gonna do low and slow we'll do it we'll do 170 for 20 minutes on each side how does that sound well all right then here we go well all right let's open it up and uh see how we did  God in there all right so then we're gonna take this guy and then we're gonna put him right there here we go it's it's it's it's it's pretty good it it has way too much liquid smoke and effort for it to be excellent though if we used like less than half of what we use to have just a a small hint of smoke then it would be like a five out of five it it tastes like too much fake smoke as it is so uh whoops I mean it's not terrible it it's just that the the the the the the the Liquid Smoke taste punches you right in the face I'd much prefer the taste from the from the actual smoked sausages done in the brisket trimmings episode so I'm pretty confident that these sausages here should get a three out of five he's gonna be strong and he's got to be something else and he's gonna be fit for the fight "
