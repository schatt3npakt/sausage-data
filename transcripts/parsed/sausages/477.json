"well happy Halloween folks and uh welcome back I guess ghost in the graveyard sausage it's my favorite Halloween no baked dessert you may have seen it featured in many a TV Guide in the checkout aisle at the grocery store but it's real simple to make all you need is some chocolate pudding Cool Whip I I just realized these are the wrong kind of Oreos H hang on black Oreo shells Milano cookies and a little bit of candy corn then we're just going to make our base scrape like your life depends on it it looks like dirt already I think that was way more than the tip that's that's that's supposed to be an R all right well shoot these headstones suck it's all starting to come together almost forgot the worms if you thought my headstone calligraphy was terrible wait until you see these ghosts they make it look so easy in the TV guy a beauty she ain't but we're not here for you know ghosts in the graveyard uh beauty contest we're here to sausage this thing oh nice and easy my my only fear with this one is that it's uh all the ingredients are going to get stuck around the cork screw in there I think it's stuck around the cork screw [Music] I'm going to have to go in there with my hands and scrape it all off you know what I knew I knew this was going to happen and I did it anyway pudding is a very difficult medium to work in spooky scary sausages and shivers down your spine I know I've done this song before but there's not that many Halloween songs not again in three two one let CH and that about doeser they still made a pretty sizable sausage get off which special thanks to today's Mark boxo box artist this guy normally I don't allow the AI sausage box art but uh this one genuinely terrified me so will it Blow I think the results speak for themselves on that one I'm going to have to give that will it Blow five Mark Ruffalo here we go oh we got a we got a ow we got a burst hopefully that closes up okay I know this looks bad this side sacrificed itself so that the other side could live so uh you know let's let's take it out before any more shenan happen listen this may look like a gigantic turn but let's open it up and see how we did it's still a little drippy well okay all right I I mean yikes here we go the casing is is a complete disaster on this you can't chew through it however the pudding the Cool Whip the shower worms it's it's a tri effect of of deliciousness I I know there's other things in there but those are the three things that I can still taste it's a very tasty concoction it just doesn't make a very solid sausage so I'm going to have to give this sausage here a one and a half out of five "
