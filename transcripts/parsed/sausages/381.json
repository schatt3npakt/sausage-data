"well hey there Fox and uh welcome back I guess the Wendy's breakfast Baconator it's got big shoes to fill because the original Baconator got a four out of five and I gotta tell you right off the bat I don't think it's got it in it that's uh that's that's not that much bacon that appears to be one strip of bacon cut up into three pieces where's the bacon there's some more of it this is this is like a like a Baconator for like an infant what is that mayonnaise it's not mayonnaise bacon egg and cheese and and a sausage patty we're going to be removing most of the buns for this since they cause the sausages to burst and they don't add any flavor I'll I'll still throw in one this is how the food looks around my house when Mrs sausage visits her family for a few days why am I using my hands [Applause] Lux God looks good it's it's still you can still make out identifiable pieces in there so I think it's time for a regrind [Music] now that's looking more unidentifiable it's getting sausage here so take off all your clothes I am getting sausage with a little bit foreign 's got to tell me where that water is coming from in three two one let's Shaw said well not for nothing but three breakfast baconators will get you four decently shy sausages Which special thanks to today's Mark boxelo box artist this guy I think the audience has become more clever than I am well if you know you know shall will it blow [Music] I didn't even make it well you made it out of the tube but it didn't even hit the box I'm I'm gonna have to give that will it blow in a half a Ruffalo [Music] usually I cook these things at like 200 degrees but I'm sick of them bursting so I'm gonna I'm gonna go super low it at at 160 and see how that does oh well all right uh here we go yeah that's the the sound of sausages barely cooking all right I think it's time we oh it Burst when I picked it up oh my God another one get out of the pan good Lord we were we were almost there a 50 success rate well I suppose that's better than a 100 failure rate which is what we're used to so uh that's what it looks like and you I'm gonna pick up so gently it looks good here we go it's it's good it's rail guy uh of course it's you know not the most solid of sausages but it's it's it's it's we we've had mushy errors is what I'm trying to say it's not oozing out but you you can see the the softness inside of there an incredibly flavorful sausage despite the looks of the sandwich the the the sausage has a very bacony flavor I I would I would probably eat this in the mornings instead of a hamburger come on let's think outside the box Wendy's let's make some breakfast sausages I say it's even better than the original Baconator sausage to show that I prefer this one a little bit more I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a four and a half out of five listen to the grease yeah that's crazy "
