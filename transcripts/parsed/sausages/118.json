"hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess so every recipe i've looked up for alligator sausage it seems like it's made up on the fly and there's really not one way in particular to make an alligator sausage it just it just looks like chicken and it and it feels like chicken did they just show me did they just sell me chicken you're supposed to cube it in order to turn it into sausage but i'm pretty tired after that we're just gonna chuck them in as is it's starting to feel gross now [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so you know we'll give it a little bit of that one of these i remember when rock was young me and sausage had so much fun it's re-grind time all right let's grind that gator [Music] [Applause] i i i i'm gonna have to i gotta go ahead and say it it's third regrowing time but the biggest kick i ever got was doing a thing called the crocodile oh wait a crocodile isn't an alligator [Music] will it blow raw alligator right up right up on my lips here a little bit a little bit and again we got a little distance on the long one there too so i'm gonna give this will it blow a two mark ruffalos shine rise shall shed shine time to rock and roll albert steinstein [Applause] well all right let's you know see how we uh did certainly certainly looks like a sausage but does it taste like a sausage that is that is the question that we still have to answer so let's ride forward to the tasting table and this will be our steed [Music] ah okay it's uh it's time to taste the sausage uh but first we don't we don't have any any sausage uh uh any sausage yard to to display today i guess no one and no one wants to send me sausage art so let's move on to the uh on to the um tasting of the sausage no reason to waste any more time our show you know it's the alligator our sausage let's let's let's go ahead and try this bad boy absolutely delicious it doesn't taste um fishy instead it tastes more like chicken uh however it it it's stringy it's not held together like one solid sausage it feels more like a bunch of itty bitty pieces of meat that are that are loosely connected but what a flavor i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a four out of five pop pop "
