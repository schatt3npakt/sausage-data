"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess now every other time we've tried to make a steak sausage it's always ended up tasting like long hamburger but this time i feel that with the toughness of the steak and the amount of fat on this steak we're gonna have a real chance at making a steak sausage that doesn't taste like ground beef even though once it goes through the grinder that's essentially what it is but but look at how beautiful this skirt steak is huh huh so for this for this sausage we're gonna hit it with the old sausage spice ingredients we're gonna hit it with some salt and pepper and the garlic and onion powder twins oh you know what we should have done first was cut this up so that it could go through the grinder now that's what i call steak ready to go through the grinder volume two uh-oh did somebody say re-grind time [Music] i think it could use just a pinch marsha oh shoot i'm gonna guess that this is gonna be at least a four out of five well you had to well you had to be a big sausage ginger in three two one let's just change you are the casing king young and sweet in his mid-30s with special thanks to today's mark boxalo box art this guy so will it blow we got his ankle i'm gonna have to give that will it blow one mark ruffalo what is on my finger i oh so i'm gonna have to give that willow plow one mark ruffalo's here we go there's just a whole bunch of fat just using out of this thing that looks done let's get it out of the pan well all right let's open it up and see how we did oh wow is that a swing and a mess well there it is it looks extremely extremely greasy this bun has seen better days i think i accidentally sat on it okay here we go uh the good news is it doesn't taste like hamburger but it doesn't taste like skirt steak either the bad news is it it it it it it doesn't it it's it's not a four out of five uh type of sausage here it's it's not worth the price of of steak to to turn it into a sausage texturally it's got some nice chew to it that you don't find in it in a normal pork sausage i think this sausage is is more in line with like like a three and a half out of five show a final score a 3 and a half out of 5. just roll roll roll it up into little circles we should have chopped this up before we added seasoning to it "
