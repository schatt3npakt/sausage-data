"well hey there folks and welcome back I guess let's go rotisserie chicken of course they're famous for their dollar fifty hot dogs but I I just devoted a whole episode to hot dogs so we're gonna focus on their chicken instead for only five dollars you get this big hunking piece of chicken oh you got it you gotta love that potato dextrin of course we have done chicken on this show before but never a rotisserie chicken and especially not one at The Bargain Basement price of five dollars you know for once I'm I'm saying that this is a good deal ah Fit For A King oh the Costco Secrets Finally Revealed and you get a free piece of string with every chicken God the sounds it's making I did chill this in the fridge so that it would be easier to tear all the chicken apart not bad we got I think most of the meat off of these bones and we got a ton of meat to sausage with all right I'm I'm I'm I'm pretty sure we got all the bones out but if not the grinder will sing a different story now that the thought process is that there's enough skin and collagen and general grease to keep this chicken moist I'm I'm hoping the skin is our Saving Grace here foreign T prepared for how much meat this was actually gonna produce I feel like there's more chicken now than when we originally started man that's how that's all right that's gonna make a whole lot of chicken sausage you make me feel like I'm living a short [ __ ] dream the way you put the casing on if I could just say once again that five dollars is what a what a value that is I I hope this comes out of the tube this this may be too dry we will cross that bridge when we get to it oh oh God oh the heavy ones always cause the most problems but I don't want to sound like a SIM for Costco I have some gripes about Costco really really it's about the people that shop at Costco it's it's it's survival of the finished over there you gotta you gotta you're fighting with everyone to get those rotisserie chickens a lot of bloodish spilled in the aisles that's all I'm saying it's like uh it's like Mad Max with shopping carts and you may be saying well that's not Costco's fault isn't it though all right well let's hope that's enough casing because that's a whole lot of chicken well there's there there's no chicken water so that's in this case that's not a very good sign we're up in the dryness level on this quite a bit and three two one and here's another thing about Costco the whole premise is that you buy and bulk to save money but I bought like a tub of toothpaste and and a rotisserie chicken and I walked out of there with you but I'm spending like two hundred dollars that's a thin sausage I think I'm gonna have to grab more casing we're about two-thirds the way done and and we still got a ton of this they're still there's still a little bit left in the canister but I'm not too worried about it it's certainly not the most attractive looking sausage doesn't it look like guts I don't think I'm gonna make it charged with special thanks to today's Mark box a little box artist this guy remember the time the Ruffalo box was I think all the mess on the Box gives it character this Willard blow is

Helix mattress there's no chance well that that ain't that ain't gonna blow I APO I apologize you deserve so much better than that oh that's not very good I I don't I don't think there's enough room in the pan for both of these all right I'll tell you what we'll do this one will go in the pan this one will throw in the toaster oven see which one's better here we go huh give it some breathing room okay yeah this this one's done well it's it's a it's a difference that you can see clearly but is it a difference that you can taste that's that that's what we're gonna find out so uh you know let's let's open them up and see how we did this one of course is the uh uh what this is the one that we baked in the toaster oven I'm in it it doesn't it it doesn't look too dry I guess but we'll see how this one does almost identical all right I'm gonna try this one first because I think that it will taste worse here we go it's it's not bad but the chicken is dry and now we'll try the pan seared surprisingly this isn't as dry they basically taste the same the only difference is is the level of dryness and um the the color even though both Skins are crispy this one looks like it was boiled I'm in a conundrum because on the one hand it tastes better than cat food sausage but it's it's not really better than cat food sausage you don't get that rotisserie taste to it once it's ground up and then cooked again uh so I think I'm gonna have to settle on giving this sausage here on three out of five life also just try getting out of a Costco they got longer lines than Disney World but they have a 12 pound USDA prime brisket for like forty dollars so what am I gonna do "
