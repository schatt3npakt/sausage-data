"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess not just before we started filming i looked up the the properties of a dragon fruit and apparently it's tasteless so really not a not a very good subject for today's uh sausage look at that right down the center well two-thirds from the center that's pretty dead that came out pretty easily that well that wasn't so bad all right let's let's try one of these bad boys um it really it really doesn't taste much of anything it tastes um a little sweet not a lot of high hopes on this being a a very flavorful sausage oh god my wrist wow is that frozen solid oh yeah i forgot to plug it in [Music] we may have a slight problem happening inside of the grinder there's a a very distinct lack of of dragon fruit all right let's just take a a teensy look here and and there's the fun that looks awful but uh you know we're gonna we'll put our classic seasonings in of salt and what he introduces as his roommate pepper oh yeah you know what it actually doesn't look all that bad we've got to install microwave ovens custom sausage deliveries [Music] in three two one let shawshank and and that and then that's it that's all she wrote which special thanks to today's mark boxalo box artist this guy so will it blow oh and oh it slid off but we we can clearly see from the from the instant replay that that hit dead center and it left a pretty pretty girthy projection as well oh so i'm gonna have to give that will it blow three more gruffalos here we go oh i burst it that's quite a burst i mean it it looks cooked on the inside so why don't why don't we get that sausage out of the pan before it bursts even more well it's already open so there's no there's you know we can't we can't see how it is even more than it already is show so there it is and it look it still looks pretty tasty if you ask me if you if you ignore those things that look like mouse turds do one of these and one of those and there you have quite a delicious looking something or other okay here we go a couple of things to be said here the the dragon fruit provided no extra flavor whatsoever all it all it managed to do was to lick the juice out of the pan and prevent our skin from crisping up but second of all you you you do get the wonderful crunch of these little seeds in there making you think that there's there's there's like little pieces of styrofoam or something like uncooked rice maybe you know it just it just tastes like a normal you know normal sausage pretty disappointing dragon fruit's not the way to go on sausages so i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 2 out of 5.
