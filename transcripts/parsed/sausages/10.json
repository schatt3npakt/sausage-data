"well hey there folks welcome back I guess to another episode here and what an episode we have a lot of people have been asking this by name but a lot of people have just been saying you know if you could just do some Chinese food Arnold that'll be terrific for us alright so I figured I'd go to I go to at Panda Express here take a look at their famous orange chickens and figured we'd turn that into some sausages thank you and you know that not everybody's got a Panda Express so I figured maybe would go over the anatomy of an orange chicken and basically what you got is you got your clump of chicken here and they fry it so it's got a little bit of a hard shell on it but the longer it sits in that sauce it's gonna it's gonna get a little bit mushy ER and there you go it's just chicken coated in flour and uh there are this I think it's aptly named correctly and then of course you got your lo mein or I think they actually call it chow mein and it's this isn't actually my favorite thing on the menu I think it's kind of plain tasting but you put that together with the orange chicken and you and you've got yourself some magic baby [Music] okay so we made some pretty quick work of that it's definitely very mushy if I take it and hold it and clump it together it holds a shape you know I that's off to Panda Express this thing just went through the grinder like bottom and I tell you what they don't even pay me to say that this is this is just a free plug for Panda Express so if you're going to turn your Chinese food into a sausage look no further than Panda Express okay three two one it's sausage time you know what yeah I don't like that let's not use them in making sausages doesn't always have to be working you can also have fun there's this tube often gets stuck with the remnants of the food is not enough Laura but didn't it I push it out so what you can do is put your mouth right on up to it and I think we were on the right track keeping the sausages linked last time I think we went wrong with the sausage flip but you know yeah you gotta try things in order to learn from your mistakes so uh I'm kind of glad that we did that so let's show try keeping them linked again and not doing I'm not throwing the sausage flip so far so good I mean you could you could swear that these are bratwurst but that that's orange chicken and chow mein speaking of speaking too soon there you go I think these are pretty well cooked enough let's get the rest out before we start to you know turning into the monster from tremors over here let's take a look at how we did and there it is it's it it's not much of a looker but yeah but thank you know and it's how it tastes not how it looks so let's move on to the testing of the taste and that just sort of dawned on me that we forgot to include the fortune cookie so you know let's let's try to fix that a little a little garnish I'm excited for this one let's get skip it a taste test here it's Panda Express orange chicken and chow mein sausage so that the chow mein is what I taste the most out of this I would say it tastes about 90% like the chow mein and the other percent it tastes like a little bit of the orange chicken sauce you would never be able to tell that there's actually chicken in this thing you know I think I want to revisit this one with just the orange chicken because I think that that would be a much tastier sausage because the chow mein kind of neutralized the tang enos in the spiciness of the orange chicken and it just made it taste a little bit bland with all that chow mein in there so you know for being a sausage I'm gonna give this a 2 out of 5 but an asterisk we will be revisiting this one with just the orange chicken so there it is two out of five bop-bop-bop and no one says that you have to do it right the first time you know there's plenty of second chances when you're doing sausages so we'll keep that in mind and we'll get it right the next time "
