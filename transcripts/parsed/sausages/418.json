"we'll hear that folks and uh welcome back I guess so today we're doing a smoked Shawarma sausage try to say that three times fast smoked Shawarma shot smoked Shawarma sausage there wait that wasn't so hard okay never mind uh I'll show not only are we gonna be doing the the beef Shawarma here we're gonna be doing the the peanuts and we're gonna be doing the the rice man that's a lot of beef and we're also going to be doing the salad as well with pita chips I guess those are so the whole kit and the caboodle we're gonna throw this all in the grinder and and stuff it and then throw it in the smoker and we will finally see if if that's something that you should also do at home or not who who knows you know you never really know until until the final moments oh it's it's never it's it can never just come right out it's always gotta just spill all over the table first gotta find the hole oh you know what this came with the sauce hang on there's the sauce I think it's tahini and water it smells mostly like the salad if if I were to give a prediction right now I would say that this sausage is probably going to be like a three out of five yeah you make me feel alike I've been locked out of Shaw's age for too long long far too long it's not a good one good job oh that's the Shawarma water in three two one let's shush [Music] get back on there and that's all there is it's hard to believe but all that food led us to only six sausages although they do look pretty tasty what do you think these are gonna taste like once they go through the smoker I bet they're gonna taste like smoke at any rate they're gonna be thrown in the smoker at 275 for two hours which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy look it looks just like me and it looks like green Mark Ruffalo but will it blow you gotta be kidding me you're stinking up the joint Rock wow that's pretty disappointing I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow one Mark Ruffalo I'm gonna help these wood chips out pecan there we go about halfway done they're done well they they certainly smell Smoky but uh you know let's open one up and see how we did it's gonna be a mushy one there you go my friend here we go it is show darn good there's no reason to beat around the bush here these are five out of five sausages that we're just calling it right away um usually salad is a detriment to sausage but it's uh the the whatever herbs were in there and and spices it's incredible No One's Gonna argue with you that these don't taste like smoke but they also taste like like the Shawarma and you know it it is soft but it it's it's it's it's it's hanging in there you know it's it's it's it's still like a solid sausage not mashed potatoy at all you know the rice the beef ever everything every the I guess the pita as well oh you know what I probably should have saved one for well whatever it's really changed my mind on how smoked sausages can work because before I was just like well it's just it just makes things taste like smoke but this it it has it has upgraded the sausage whereas if we were to pan sear it it would have burst if we would have stuck it in the toaster oven you know it would have burst so that's the score I'm gonna have to give these sausages here a five out of five pop [Music] "
