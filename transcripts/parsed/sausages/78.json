"and uh boy everyone's uh here so early i i i didn't expect anyone uh to to be here right now i'm just fiddling fiddling around with the with the live stream settings so uh you know sit back and uh you know relax and uh you know you know give me a second you know there's no rush there's no rush it's halloween right you can give me a couple of minutes to figure out these settings hey everybody hey there uh andy foggs hey there uh that mimer good to see you and uh laurel ruiz thanks for stopping by on your halloween uh night to uh to spend a little halloween treat with me will we have some tricks no i i didn't really plan for any of that but we will be making a sausage which is you know without the whole point of why we're here so uh you know it's the end of the spooky month it's yes and it's a good day good to see uh so many people uh showing up oh look i just got a youtube reminder on my on my own phone that uh that that i'm streaming uh i should probably turn on like uh uh uh what's it called the do not disturb but i i don't wanna accidentally you know end uh the stream i always have to check the settings to make sure that you know that uh slow mode is turned on otherwise it the stream just gets inundated with so much chat so you go to more options and we'll just do that i'm sure there's a way to have that on by default but i haven't cared to uh look at that so that's you know that's why that's there so all right i think that's pretty good so uh oh no i i wasn't even looking at the donations already is there a way for me to look oh there we go a guillermo la desma hey happy birthday buddy thanks for the donation there and uh voltron force uh thank you as well is november going to keep me busy well yes but i mean i'm not going to be doing uh a a a a thanks a whole month of thanksgiving that's we just did that for october and uh i'm i'm you know tired i'm you know over it i'm ready for i'm ready to move on to tell you the truth and i think everyone else is as well and uh thanks lunch or uh lux i hope i'm saying that right next is a cream pie sausage well hey maybe maybe well it is after dark so maybe and elmer j fapp thank you so much would you be would you make a banana sausage sure uh you know banana might be the only fruit that's that that could be sausage ified since all the other ones are just so liquidy so you know here's a pie that we got from uh publix and uh i haven't tasted it yet so i'm gonna go ahead give it a shot oh it's a it's a waste to be turning this into a sausage or maybe not because this is a really good pot uh publix bakeries makes uh that not not even sponsored this video that just that's just a plug for their bakery because they they always come through in florida wherever you go anywhere you're going to get a publix treat and that's just that's just how it is and uh they did did i miss it okay good and uh strumming anyways thank you for the donation can you wish holding a happy birthday and halloween thank you we love you well yeah yeah of course i can do that hey uh happy birthday holden i hope you have a happy halloween thank you for joining me on this uh joyous occasion so i mean the first thing i mean that i mean it goes into the grinder right that's that's what we got to do oh my goodness and i gotta be i'm really hoping these i had uh thank you to uh marshall goodman a halloween festivus yes it is and uh sauce g no i'm serious thank you for the donut stop with the guys i got to start sausaging this thing at some point i ever thought of a of a spit sausage no you know i i hadn't thought of that can you say hi bear we're we're both watching i don't well is that that's not part of the quotes hi bear we're both watching but maybe that is part of it i don't know i work at a publix deli it's a nightmare but the tender subs are worth it yeah you know i i it's it's usually blasphemy to hear a public's employee say anything other than good things about public so that this is a rare treat tonight uh thank you for the donation and uh uh did i read your name off that was wesley mccormick i gotta get better at reading these names off uh cheese mcpease was the one who thought of the spit sausage and uh we got that one jonathan haggard was for the uh high bear and uh this is so much harder when you're by yourself uh happy halloween you make an enchilada sausage well that sounds like an order and uh you know may you probably we haven't done uh any mexican food besides tacos and burritos i think we should probably some you know some some some cuisines that maybe aren't so uh taco belly and chipotle uh oh i wait i need my measuring cup see when i say that there's zero prep work that goes into this show i mean it because but that measuring cup is like the that's like this when you come to ordinary sausage you think of the sausages and you think of that measuring cup so i'm doing a disservice to this live stream by by it not being here oh there it is there you are you're dirty you cannot be used we will have to settle for the younger brother which you know he tries his best you know he's you know he's not it not as good as as as the uh as as that one but you know he's just second in command let's see and kaylee rupp thank you for the donation can you possibly make awful sausage or awful sausage you know i've never heard anyone actually pronounced it only written so uh i'm stupid you should have you should have learned that by now watching this show uh yes we we there's more more some more innards are on the way of the animal uh let's see so uh tarantula wedding weddenberg no whipped cream uh no no whipped cream sorry about that buddy uh well there was whipped cream on the key lime pie sausage and that's like all i could taste ah i'd say scott turner thank you for the donation can you make a soup souffle sausage uh probably i'm about to go to trial voluntary manslaughter says cheese mcps all right all right let's okay stop donating let's let's start sausaging this is this is why we're here this is why we're here it's uh it's fight me it's certainly a fighter i don't think i've encountered this kind of a fight since the matzah that was that was the money shot we caught that just in time for that drop people people who just turned in right at that second that was the optimal okay that was the new optimal time that what that was a good that was a good clark it plurt right out of there did you cut you there we go so all right that that's that that's that's got to be enough right and look it we it was just enough it was the perfect amount of measuring cup to catch to catch our energy and uh this looks actually pretty appetizing i you know it what else could it look like it could it just turned like a brighter shade of what it was oh yeah all the pies always taste so good hey oh man i'm better missing like these donations like crazy oh i'm not good if i missed anyone a super fan keep track of any of any that i missed okay just make a sausage you want to make with the proper ingredients that's not what this show's about well robbie thomas but uh i appreciate the encouragement and uh schlemmer toots can i have your sausage

um jj k who did the sausage logo design looking to get a waffle done like that uh that was techcrate on twitter he did the sausage logo design right so go ahead and uh check on our london and i'll take over the donations so let me give you my assessment on this it's uh you know it's it's probably we should probably just mark it under disqualified because this is barely holding up as a sausage and it's really just i'm just basically ripping with my teeth through this and not even even getting casing it's like rubber it's so stretchy that i'm like dragging out the innards with my teeth so i you know of course the insides you know are crazy delicious because it's just concentrated sweetness as always someone just said one out of five in the chat and you know i'm yeah i'm thinking that's yeah that's probably yeah it's tough this is a tough one this is this one's a thinking man sausage hmm officially i'm i'm i'm ah [Applause] i don't wanna i'm gonna i'm gonna stick with one i'm gonna stick with one that's it cause you you know it we did get it on the bun and it did cut it and it did stay in the skin technically it's just an eating challenge gosh so i wanted one out of one out of five but boy but we still got tons of time on this live stream so i guess uh well we'll spend the remainder of the time uh answering uh questions uh and uh uh singing uh songs that and uh and reading
