"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess and you may be saying mr sausage that seems like a pretty standard sausage for you to be making not the way i'm gonna make it starting with this block of frozen cheddar if you're looking for low effort then look then look no further yeah that's that's weird looking what oh my god that the cheese the cheese block the grinder of all the things that that that has clogged the grinder a frozen block of cheese i never would have expected perhaps some jalapenos to uh to send this cheese on its way now we're just going to add some pork to balance out that flavor oh my knife and we'll just do that [Music] uh initial reaction uh oh this this looks like what comes out of a goose transfer to a somewhat larger ball and and and to add to our flavor profile we have salt and his his possible lover pepper give it some hydration so it comes out of the tube oh baby my heart is full of sausage and dessert for you in three two one let's just [Music] and we have reached the end of the sausage mamma mia that's a big spicy sausage that's a that's a whole lot of sausage hey mrs sausage do you want some of this no don't gotta be a jerk about it with special thanks to today's low effort mark boxalo box art this guy so will it blow it looks like like a three-way tie between the middle the right and the bottom not a whole lot of spread going on uh but but a direct hit so i'm gonna have to give that will it blow two mark ruffalos okay here we go [Music] that's probably good enough let's get it out of the pan well all right let's open it up and see how we did it looks uh it looks interesting what else can be said here we go okay a couple of things here this tastes exactly like a philly cheesesteak hot pocket exactly like a philly cheesesteak hot pocket so that's a little concerning second of all the the casing is nonsense that the casing is so gummy it's not the best tasting sausage ever made but it's certainly better than some of the other stuff we've made ah but but as it stands now i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 3 out of 5. you're as cold as ice willing to sacrifice "
