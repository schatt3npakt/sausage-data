"eggs hey it's me i try the things you see and then i let you know if you should buy it all right so we have eggs in three ways we have we have them uh well uh uh you know uh uh uh a hard-boiled egg cooker or any style for that matter a classic uh omelette maker and this thing i will admit that i have the damnedest time uh trying to cook my my eggs properly here's some pictures of some eggs you know we need we need some eggs for this for this uh test i i want to try uh uh soft boiling these eggs to me soft boiling is the hardest one to get right then you gotta just ever so gently just all right in there then you put it the the cap on here and then you then you turn then you turn it on and then then you wait this thing just started this it started singing on me this is just gonna keep doing that i hope i don't get a copyright strike for this all right so let's let's let's see if it worked all right that's it that's enough out of you you know what yeah that's probably soft-boiled how to get it out of the shell is the next problem we're gonna we're gonna this is gonna be a battle of the who's got the omelettius omelet so something that i learned off camera is that this thing turns on as soon as it's plugged in this one we gotta fill it up with water and this one doesn't require any of that kind of nonsense and then the rest is for oh it's already going i guess each one of these things uses you know two two eggs and then this thing goes here and then we're here we go we gotta we got a battle going [Music] all the songs back all right well there's our omelette and as you can see it's you know not looking as as as such this this one i think is is done as well there's one omelette and here we did bam there it is here's your omelet right there they may not look like the most appealing omelets and heck the pepper just floated straight on this one that side's not better let's try a little piece here of our omelet this one tastes like you you you microwaved a cup of eggs and and now we'll try the what have you over here it mostly tastes like scrambled eggs i'm ready to make a a determination on these first two products if you live in a place where you know you don't have access to a pot of water this is a good replacement for that so i would say for the for the hard-boiled eggs that this is definitely worth uh buying all right now this thing on the other hand is uh not very good it doesn't make your eggs into omelets it makes it like uh baked eggs uh so should should you buy should you buy the omelette maker no you shouldn't buy it now we're moving on to the to the to the all right so we got the rolly here and just this a very thick owner's manual this is this is too many pages to be reading in order to operate this you may need to shake it out of there or poke it with a stick is what this thing tells you so it doesn't work half the time and and now for one to two large eggs all right i admit that was that was too much force oh good lord i love that noise that's a beautiful noise all right here we go here it's done look at it girl oh my god it's like it's taking a sh let's see how this this rolly compares well i probably should have washed this before using it because the whole thing tastes like chemicals should you buy it no you shouldn't buy it i'm sorry missha oh i am for real oh i i did not need to see the egg water i bet you i can gross out all the viewers in three two one let's uh who keeps shutting this thing to go off it's me i'm the one who keeps shutting it so that it goes off that's exactly how i like my egg sausages as thick as the day is long you came to the wrong side of egg town buddy will it blow this thing's not blowing anywhere i i award you zero mark ruffalos let's go gary busy sausage you know what we haven't done a sausage flipping forever they keep bursting when we do it so i mean so that's the primary reason but you know let's yeah let's do it anyway that's exactly why we stopped doing the sausage flips in the first place and so that that's you know what it looks like on the inside just completely cook you you've never seen an egg cook this much in your life all right and now we'll you know put it in a barn and eat it and then then then we wait for the next show to happen but first we got some fan mail to open hold hold on let me get this screen bigger this package comes all the way from the country of austria and there it is looks like some of this guy's work we're dealing with a professional here all right i gotcha i got some oil on the packaging but what is better than a mark [Laughter] my ruffalo terry this is perfect i can't thank you enough thank you mrs sausage we're gonna have to find a place of high honor for this and now on to the tasting put it right in the thing right there you know no time like the present you know i said it before the last time we made an egg sausage and i'll say it again this is not bad at all obviously the recipe can be improved upon since we only seasoned it with salt and pepper and the inside taste of the uh rolly i think that this one day could be a five out of five sausage but this sausage in particular i'm gonna give this sausage in particular a three and a half out of five we now have an answer on how long it takes for me to go through an entire package of sausage casing the answer is six months six months how do you how i forgot how you open these things "
