"well hey there folks connect can everyone hear me there's usually like like a 15-second delay before I realize that you know that there's people that can hear me or not and so yeah I'm just gonna wait to see yes yes we can hear you before you know I move on briefly things still kosher all right I think I think you can hear me so welcome to The Accidental a public livestream this was you know supposed to be a livestream just for the patrons but you know yours truly you know set it up wrong and set it up public so welcomes everyone go thank the patrons for this wonderful livestream that we're about to do also you know we have an hour to get through you know only two MREs but you know I don't think it's gonna take us that long but you know don't worry we got a ton of these MREs laying around because I forgot to say hey we're good on MREs too late so now the house is filled with MREs and you know whoa I forgot whose MREs these were but what you know will credit them you know when we do a highlight video because obviously not everyone's gonna see this uh well I say you know we get started with everyone's favorite well know you tell me audience you tell me do you want that the chicken chunks white cooked or the red shape to barbecue flavored pork patties oh I'm so it obviously the rebbe is it's all red all I'm seeing is ribs so you know you know with a title like chicken chunks white cooked I don't see how that Lots but here we are and yeah I got a little I got a little opening up the box this was in you know I kind of stabbed the MRE but I don't it didn't pierce the underneath so give that a rip down the center and this is what we got here well this is it this is the rib shaped barbecue pork patty in all of its glory look how thin you see what else we got here we've got the banana nut Ranger bar tff I love the tff you know you people don't put enough tff and in there stuff more toilet paper Bart oh the barbecue sauce okay okay that's good and oh and by the way apparently everyone else in their mom knew that this this opens lengthwise because it's supposed to be like a bowl because you don't have you know a plate but but no one else wanted to check the comments so there's like a million comments of people telling me the same thing of oh yeah it's because you don't have a plate out there you're supposed to use the dang that the package itself is your bowl and plate what's this apple jelly wonderful you know that's going in there creamer well this is this is a zero calorie sweetener I thought I thought calories were important so why would you make it zero calorie wouldn't you want to put calories into the thing because you're trying to put as much calories into the soldiers what the heck is this now ooh freeze-dried coffee and I you know if you're not getting yourself iodized you know who are you buddy you know get get your act together you got to get those ayodhya iodization 'z Enya and a moist towelette and when you're done you know just two pieces of gum dad there's a million things in here there's the long spoon there's the long spoon now correct me if I'm wrong but this spoon totally goes all the way down it so what's the I'm bringing this back up because you're supposed to do it lengthwise for the bowl but look this this easily reaches just this way it's so easy to do it this way instead of this way all right we got what the heck is this this is this is the breaded wheat snack that everyone's told me to hey watch out there's there's a poisonous packet in there that's gonna kill you as soon as you eat it so you know don't eat that so yes I will be aware not to put the poisonous the poisonous moisture-wicking also there's still more stuff tropical punch flavored there's no fruit juice in this in this juice that's the first time I've seen 0% juice usually it's like 5% well I don't think that's going in there I'm gonna drink this because I'm you know I'm already thirsty and there's the activator what is this now what you got to do math in the field ok well I got a cup I don't need to I don't need to mess with this bag so that's good well it's uh see the ingredients were going to use this was the SantaFe rice and beans Oh they'd even say that this was included you get santa fe rice and beans with the herbs with your beef patty yeah you like that chin yeah you can you can watch that chin all day long buddy all right ok let's open up these let's see how ribs shape they really are well that's you know disappointing oh hey mrs. sausage hey come look at this now when you see when you when you hear the phrase rib shaped rib shaped does that come to your it does look like a McRib it does but we're gonna we're gonna mix it with the rice and we're gonna mix it you know with the beans oh you know what I just realized I didn't heat this up do we really need to heat it up though it is precooked yeah well we'll heat up the the Magnificent rice and beans but boy if I could just tell you the smell that's going it is you can hear mrs. sausage gagging in the background all right I did forget to heat it up though that what that's a rookie mistake but you know you basically it's already it's already cooked so you yeah well like we're gonna we're gonna use these Santa Fe rice and beans and clean it all up there we go we did tear it in all right and it says to fill it with you know you know a sizable amount of water where's the overfill line well I'm pretty sure that that just went straight over the overfill line but we're gonna where's my where's my hot pocket sleeve this is are you heating up in there I don't think that this is heating up you better heat up when I tell you to heat up do we have a question from the audience okay it's heating up now I feel the heat God look at that just that rib sausage or it will be rib sauce is that rib that rib shaped pork patty is really just the star of the show all right they stay I think that's going to heat up at some point but they say you know not to do this inside because this the fumes are a little bit toxic so I'm supposed to shake it Oh how often do they want me to shake this all right Chuck I just you know and and you know they tossed its shots pretty good but in case that there was any where's now what did I do with the sauce there's more of that there's more of that sauce where it came from in this packet well I say well that's heating up well you know we don't really have much time to wait we gather that we got to get going here so go get the bowl out [Music] and it just it crumbles just the way you thought a rib should again that cutting it lengthwise makes total sense because you want to eat it like it's out of a bowl right people Oh the barbecue sauce isn't that bad well that's about as much of the rib meat that you got it kind of looks awful that sawdust that no one convinced me that that is not sawdust [Music] all right how long is this supposed to take the cook it feels it doesn't feel hot it feels warm it feels warm and I don't see any of that wonderful scheme that I saw in the last one you're soaked yourself why don't you eat enough get in there look that's a really matter if it's hot or not I mean if this thing starts heating up on its own I'm gonna be super super angry well this makes no sense to open it sideways well there's your brace and beans I mean that's why we're putting it through the grinder but why you know I made one comment that we put everything in the grinder and now you can't even make a water sausage without putting it in the grinder first where's Mike here we go turn this back on [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well what else what else I mean I feel like I've been transported to to Santa Fe New Mexico with with that with that rice see what we got here these are the hot pockets the pizza hot pockets you know I'm not going to put this in there because all it will do is just make it first it adds no flavor whatsoever so we know that from the last MRE what is it banana nut Ranger bar that definitely looks like a banana nut Ranger bar oh boy is that spicy what a mess what a mess all this is out there goes to spoon yeah all right give it you know we'll give it a little stir by the way that rib meat in case in case you're late that red meat is sawdust you know who's ever manufacturing the the rib meat boy are they having a laugh at the government's expense because that is sawdust there's no actual meat in there well I guess we should you know put it in the stuffer the moist towelette we're not putting the moist towelette in there you want all right let's have a vote who wants the apple jelly it takes about 15 seconds all right we have a no we have a yes we have a yes we have oh it's even oh no it's all right dude oh boy all right the guesses have it yeah we girl oh it's just so gelatinous you know think that open from the side you know otherwise you know how tearing it the other way that spoon would never have fit in there how would this have possibly have worked no only this way apparently oh you want me to turn on donate donations and I yeah so this was an accidental livestream public live stream so that setting isn't turned on this this was supposed to just be for patrons but I accidentally made it public so I owe my patrons another live stream one that is in public but yeah if you want to contribute you know buy a shirt or you know think about becoming a patron and then see you know live streams that you were supposed to be private but turned out to be public anyway so you know that could be that could be you right now everyone's favorite part of course is dealing with the intestines and you know they're like headphones that you know you would throw in your backpack and that they get tangled very easily the longer they are so you know a good amount of time is spent just trying to sort sort this mess out all right look we got some of that we got some of that rib oil still yeah we got we got this Darvish going on we cut to the stuffers not exactly at the same level as the board here get this a little wet give it a little grease why do you always have to make me look like a fool in front of people can't you just go on like a normal by the way this is cut out of every video me me messing with trying to get this in fact the entire live stream could probably just be me trying to get this done for an entire hour where are you [Music] good let them let them see my feet ah get up good god what a pain in the pain and uh you know I'm not sure if this is gonna stay up full or if I'm gonna make it a high light thing so I'm probably just not gonna swear you know I don't want to get demonetised again for almost saying the F word not saying it by the way not even I thought I found a loophole in a YouTube's you know thing there and they said you're not allowed to swear in the first 30 seconds on your video and you're not allowed to bleep out any swearing in the first second of your video or the first 30 seconds of your video otherwise you'll get demonetised well you know I'm not even gonna repeat it although it has been more than 30 seconds alright so what we're going to do now is not tie this off yet because we still need to we still need to get the air out of here so now it's right at the tube so now we can tie it off and not having to worry about this filling up with all that air and any questions from the audience I have mrs. sausage reading off questions so why oh I don't need this on anymore because there's no you know gases or whatever what's my day job this is my day job oh yeah I forgot that this wasn't you know so all of that made one sausage and I am not kidding oh you could get your sausage tasting either online but I get my sausage casing from the local butcher my butcher makes sausages in-house and so many butchers do and I said hey buddy can I get some of that sweet sausage casing that you're important and he said yeah so it came in a you know a plastic bucket and I took everything out and I put them in individual plastic bags am i speaking too fast oh the comments are just don't you so we're gonna give this tons of room because we are gonna let this expand like nobody's business all right note to self watch wash the kitchen shears when we're done with this I've been making sausages for I want to say ten years but it's probably closer to seven is that about seven or eight years I've been making sausages mostly normal so there haven't been any crazy lobster sausages or what happened supposedly it's just been you know trying to get back at the big big grocery for stealing all my sausage money there's two baby sausages I call oh well now we can't use that joke anymore not light a current current detentions do I not have a clean pan oh nothing like starting the live stream with the dirty pan missus sausage entertaining the folks who always wash the pan hey mister sausage do you have the time 12:27 we got it we got to get going because we have an entire under mr enoch are ya sure yes sir we're gonna try to get two of these - what he's done okay and another question for the audience do we poke holes or do we not poke holes no holes no hold that no I'm seeing I'm seeing more nose I'm seeing more nose than I am seeing no all right all right we're sticking with no on this one we'll compare all right I'm thinking you people just want to see a sausage versus butt is what I'm thinking all right that the count is in and we will not be poking any how many people are on right now oh my gosh well this was a very large turnout you know usually there's it's like 14 people because it's supposed to be just for the patrons but hey you know what it what a turnout what a turnout for an accidental public livestream what I just had the oil oh there it is no we had a standard we we got married in Vegas mrs. sausage and I oh wow that is way too much oil well there's gonna be a fire god no that's way too much that's you know safety first is is you know always what mr. sausage says safety first pumpkin and candy corn sausage for her for Halloween I want to make a blood sausage I think that would be appropriate I think everyone wants know how that mrs. sausage does but I think the blood sausage would be pretty pretty darn tasty you know in America we don't really appreciate blood sausages like the rest of the world does and it's a shame because it's a very it's a very good way to utilize all that blood alright these this home now oh sure why not here we go come with me and you'll see a world of pure imagination and things that we do involve saw suffocation Oh could you guys see my moustache did I reveal it on the livestream I may be I ain't got in the shot uh yeah so I've been growing this bad boy ever since the start of quarantine so that's been you know how many how many months now three or four months so I've been growing a mustache since then I revealed my face entirely oh well the jig is up the jig is up everyone oh yeah I know I did that but I meant did I do it on the livestream did I just go full on face here's my face everyone oh now I haven't okay well now that I want to do air sausage that seems like a fun one but you know there are you know microscopic holes in the sausage that will you know it eventually leaked out so it I don't think it would be possible to do an air sausage oh we got the side of my face well that's enough to it to make an identification she hates it misses sausage hates the mustache as well she should it's in it's in it's very itchy and and then it's I'm you know I've never really had a mustache at this length before I've kind of had like you know the the teenagers mustache that you know all boys do when they're around 17 years old but you know ever since then I never really come oh all the Santa Fe Rice all that Santa Fe Rice goodness oh no oh gosh now the oil splattering oh oh god that does not look appetizing oh I know what I'm a bad woman you don't think I've ever scooped out sausage enters into a hot dog bun before oh my god there's more than 5,000 people watching this what it work keep losing that spoon that's okay everyone loves the sound of metal on metal oh I forgot I left the stove on well rats well we we should have known that was gonna happen I was led astray by the don't poke holes in the sausage people so you can't blame that one entirely on me let's uh let's give this a shot see what it tastes like hmm it's really good um it kind of tastes like this you want to try it Oh Mitch the sausages didn't try it I'm like a 4 or 5 what do you think mrs. sausage Oh mrs. sauce is gonna eat it that's how good it is that's how you know I'm not lying she's gonna finish this it's really good it's really good it's a 4 or 5 habit of made it it's a the the red meat is well I mean it's sawdust but it's flavored like Park so it blends it tastes it's scientifically it's scientifically created to taste good so I don't know why we're surprised about this but it's uh it's uh you know we didn't get it in the casing but the inners itself mixed together they're surprisingly good it tastes it makes a really nice delicious treat all right so I think we have less than half an hour to do the other one so we better get cracking on this this is going right in the garbage and yes I will take requests for music if you guys need me to sing something you know just tell me what it is we can do more Wonka Wonka song I've been trying to get my kids to watch the 1971 version and they want I think they're coming around I think they're coming around at first they didn't know what to think how are you West Virginia fly me to the moon in West Virginia fly me to the moon I want to go to West Virginia Mountain Mama these are all good these are all these are all in my range let it go oh yeah the kids love that one how does that go but uh well I know it goes let it go let it go but there's like more to it than that esposito these are all good I so uh let's see and uh and and after all you're my Wonderwall I said maybe you're gonna be the one that saves me and you know take on me down at it at that oh there's the chicken look you look how beautiful these chunks are you can see the grid pattern that we're gonna be enjoying these these chicken chunks in all these the osmotics grant the current laws mutter cranberries are making a comeback these are good plain tortillas all right this is good these are really good first strike energy bar yeah apple cinnamon flavor that that seems fun that that seems like a fun one okay it's like Christmas in here M&Ms one full cheese spread with jalapenos now I believe if I recall watching MRE Steve that this is like this is like gold this is this is like very valuable for trading and what-have-you this is like one of the best tasting things if I'm remembering right this could this could be crap this is the the fruit punch from last time and the chicken and the beverage base lemonade that's sounds that sounds pretty good Oh buffalo style hot sauce and this is the this is just a gigantic bag of fruit beverage powder Oh add salt to the heater to make it work oh is it Jake Sloan thanks for the suggestion we'll add salt where that what I do with it did I just toss it willy-nilly what I do with it did this not come with the eater no that's the sleeve all right everyone in the livestream did you watch me just like Chuck the heater or maybe it doesn't get one maybe you'll eat a cold well this one's this oh there's no heater with this one well I guess that guess doesn't come with all well that's a rip all right let's say you know what I'm not gonna open this I'm not gonna open it lengthwise I'm gonna I'm gonna be a rebel that I am and cut it the way I think it should be oh this one you don't cut thankfully see this one they figure it out all right I'm not there's no eater to add salt to so we could just end that oh Jesus Christ all the chicken juice just spilled right out ah listen I think you can see that I'm not I'm not a man of combat oh there they are there's those chicken chunks and you say this is cooked good god that didn't that look cooked the things we do for the things we do for sausage all right who they putting this metal bowl back on a heater this this looks disgusting this this is it smells so bad [Music] oh there's more juice [Music] Oh [Music] it's spell all right osmotic cranberries do your stuff oh god it's true it's dripping in chicken juice [Music] and we need our energy so in chess I can't open it I mean my hands are just covered in chicken juice ah oh it's like a power bar yeah that's what it is [Music] [Music] right oh you want the M&Ms in there why not oh that was a terrible suggestion whoever wanted the M&Ms in there [Music] that just looked like we don't know what that looks like and here's I'm not gonna put all the tortillas in there because we don't want to oh the cheese spread I forgot about the cheese burger yeah [Music] all right and so we got that the cheese spread with jalapenos I don't think that's gonna go into the grinder because then we're gonna lose well lose most of the cheese spread in the grinder so come in and cut me a break with this one all that chocolatey jalapeno e goodness oh there's also um there's a buffalo style uh-huh hot sauce should that go in there too you tell me I'm gonna get this open because I know what the answer is yes I just saw one yes that's all I needed to see there you go what not to use to tie it off oh it's just a simple you do a loop it's it stays together with just one tie there's no special tie oh my god it stinks so bad it is entirely that she spread smell that fake cheese smell spread and I see little pieces of Eminem's can everyone see that there we go god it stinks no I'm not putting the fruit drink stuff in there because I'm thirsty and I do want to drink that after the after the live stream oh also I put this look I put this on top of the still hot a range of it what's just called stovetop no I didn't it didn't mouth even after being on top of the stovetop so that's really good alright it's get the are we getting a good shot of this here we can change the angle is everyone having a good time is everyone saying you know I'm glad ice but you know an hour watching this guy make some really ridiculous sausages God that that jalapeno cheese spread is just dominating dominating the census cleanup is going to be the worst it did Peter Griffin sing countryroads is that why everyone wants me to sing countryroads look it's kind of left it on here a little bit too long that doesn't want to budge keep going yeah all right so uh how's it go country roads take me home to the place I belong West Virginia Mountain momma take me home country roads I hear her voice in the mornin Mountain she calls me the radio reminds me of my home far away driving down the road I get a feeling like I should've been home yesterday yesterday country roads although it burst there we go no harm done that's what happens when you're too busy singing and not paying attention to the sausage well this made quite a bit more sausage than the other one in fact you know we should have put more casing on baby sharp well I think that this one's gonna be a bit of a problem just a second as we clean the pan out so crunchy so crunchy [Music] [Music] [Music] baby baby sausage come on kitchen what's this water and now we just wait for that pan to heat up and I don't know I can't get this thing off here all right where's my poker all right so we will poke we will poke the one that's closed off oh now this is poke did you can't poke that anymore this one we will leave on poke but with an open end oh yeah that's that's a lot of oil just put them in there I actually don't know the only part of that song I know is that the chorus I plus the rangedown gonna take some time to do the things we never had what Papa and Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Bombay red take my - hi - AG you that's just right outside my vocal range they wanted you to sing la Bamba oh well the one we didn't poke just burst so where my scissors my trusty Sydney they are just you know I'm thinking that these MREs they're not prime sausage you know making material all right we're gonna get this one out before he got a chance too all right okay this is the chocolate chicken the chocolate chicken Christ what else is in there apple cinnamon first-strike nutrition you got to M&Ms are in there I know there's a piece of tortilla in there too all right here we go we're gonna give this a shot it's so bad I had to spit it out that's a zero out of five people oh oh man not a good one to go out on well I think but I think what I think we learned a lot today um here here's some more of these this little these little guys uh we learned that combining chocolate and and jalapeno cheese spread is not a good combination with your your white chicken chunks and your apple cinnamon flavored nutrition energy bar that's what we learned today all right there's you know we still got we still got you know four minutes of the live stream left so you know I guess I'll keep singing and answering questions if you see any mister sausage Katy Perry I kissed a firework I didn't like that one I know I didn't yeah I'm not even gonna try a second bite that's how terrible that was that was a real shock to the system of how bad it tasted so like a total pig iron on his head that one yeah now unfortunately that's the only part of the song I know he's just big iron here's the rest of it let me see that James a Killer Queen Hey look at that it's a laser beam Hey everybody knows Queen summertime right here we can get Billie Jean is not my lover she's just a girl the girl says I am the one the kid is not my son well what do you think we should do with this ladies and gentlemen do you think we should do
