"on this episode of ordinary sausage we're going to souve the sausages these are these are dethawed previously frozen italian sausages this one's going to be our control sausage this guy's going to be boiled and seared this guy's going to be sous vide but not seared and this guy's gonna be sous-vide and seared so here we go this'll actually be my first time souveniring anything kerplunk and for you as well good sir [Music] [Music] well there it is that worked pretty well crank this thing up to 150 now we're just go every ever so gently we're just gonna dip it right there it looks it it looks you know like a turd and a punch bowl look at this thing go you know you're i believe you're supposed to clip it to the side uh but yeah obviously we're not doing that we're to let nature run its course meanwhile and now it's this guy's turn this episode's very tardy let chashed meanwhile again this is if you if you've ever had roommates they're they're hot cut a touch but they but they're not scalding and all that you know it's not a big uh improvement site-wise uh but they're they're they're they're quite firm though and this one we're gonna share nothing like a little hand poking never hurt anyone lit sausage number two well you are all right that's pretty good all right so the first one is uh suveed with no shear this one is uh the suv with a share and this one is boiled with a share it looks like it hasn't been cooked all the way but it it it definitely has been cooked all the way that's gonna be a bite of trust when we taste this one let's try it it's it's extremely juicy it's like the juiciest sausage i've ever had in my life and i can't i can't believe it's not raw next up on the docket here and it's uh like almost the same deal now it's time to try this one that's a bit of incredible right there that's that's a big improvement on just the sous-vide sausage now we got the boilie boy over here that probably looks the most sausage-like i would say this is your your your meat and potatoes kind of sausage right here oh that'd be a good sausage all right so here we go well they're they're all good sausages i i would say that this is the most you know weird of them this one is the juiciest one but the least flavorful one this is the this is the winner because it's it's the most flavorful and it's the juiciest this one is the second most flavorful but it's a little bit drier this one i would give a four out of five this one i would give a five out of five and this one i would give a four and a half out of five okay bye [Music] [Applause] well that didn't work "
