"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess no this is not beef tenderloin it's beef tending and uh and and what a sight it is I'm guessing this this thing here is the tendon and the rest of it I is surrounding me of some kind really my only hope is that it doesn't Jam the grinder let's cook a piece of this up and see what we're really in for here hey yep look at it go here we go [Music] here we go can't even eat it rock hard but you know what a trip through the grinder should be able to soften that up no problem [Applause] ah whoops it has become apparent that I did not think this through but that's okay it's nothing that a Little Help from our friend Mr choppy can't handle so I looked it up which I suppose had something I should have done before I started cooking uh and uh apparently you're supposed to boil tendons for several hours well say what you want about proper procedure but you know that's not how I make my sausages by the way if this clocks the grinder again it's it's going into the sausage stuffer just like this so thick well that was a nightmare but it's all gonna be worth it when it goes through the grinder without any additional issues oh good lord it's clogged pretty good I think the facts liquefying I I think we're I think we're I think we're done here that's a lot of warm unground tendon this is gonna be a bad sausage well even though there's no way that this sausage is gonna turn out well we're still gonna season it as if it had a chance so we'll hit it with some salt some pepper and a garlic and onion powder Boys Are Back in Town it's certainly going to be one chewy sausage sausage Haze all in my brain Excuse me while I kissed this guy [Music] in three two one let's sausage ah there's some big chunks of tendon going into this sausage God this is like Frankenstein sausage over here I should I should have done this for the Halloween episode Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist well now what this guy so will it blow oh yeah [ __ ] Dad look at that stickage factor not very messy will it Blow but uh you know it it did something so I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow to Mark ruffalos now I suppose what I should be doing is boiling this sausage for three hours but uh what are we without dreams here we go get it roll riding in pain well we're 20 minutes in and this thing still looks pretty darn awful well it's been 40 minutes and uh not a whole lot uh you know happening so I'm gonna boost the temperature and uh give it a give it another 30 I guess it's been an hour and a half and and the the skin is still no closer to being crispy than than ever so we're gonna give it a little help oh shots okay well we'll just call it that you know I can't remember a time where the share Pro actually helped the sausage oh wow what a what a whiff it does not look too good and I bet it's not gonna taste too good either here we go oh God it's like chewing an ear like my initial reaction was to spit the sausage out hang on I'm gonna give it a good bite though now nope well that that's a big yuck for me taste wise it's it's fine you know but it's 100 a textural thing it's chewy it's hard it's um uh it's it's pretty gross it's among the worst not even close to getting softer by the way I guess you really do have to boil that for three hours well I I mean I can't eat it I can't I can't even I can't even stomach to swallow any of it I gotta spit it all out and the Skin's not even and crispy so you know really what a disappointment all around I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a zero out of five I just well that side's completely destroyed "
