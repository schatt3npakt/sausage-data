"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess so we're do we're doing we're doing yet today this is the first time that we're gonna be using a a traditional uh grinder there's a reason people don't use you know old grinders anymore and it's easier just to throw something in an electric grinder and be done with it in seconds rather than good god hours i actually think this has the wrong attachment on it because this says that this is a bread crumber at the end of the day i think we'll have some pretty decent yak sausage before the internet if you wanted yak meat you needed to know a really weird guy you know game meats typically a very lean meat and you need as much fat as possible to not make a dry sausage this is still frozen in the center this one's a little bit more frozen it's easier to cut that way that's a little that's a little wet that's looking a little wet on the camera this isn't gonna be enough fat to not dry out the sausage so i'm gonna incorporate some pork fat with it you know but the first thing we got to do is cube this up into like one inch pieces this is a little bit too thought you want you want this a little bit firmer than that to cut look at how lean this meat is there's no fat there at all this one's a lot more frozen this is about the consistency you want to cut so when this was originally uh constructed in in 1899 i guess that they had thinner countertops back then this doesn't fit the countertop we have a simple solution here we're just gonna have to hold on for dear life when we start cranking this thing we're gonna load her up which um with some delicious yak meat and we're gonna see if we can turn it into into uh breadcrumbs apparently just completely missing the plate underneath it what the hell is this this is quite a work out here hold on i'm sending in some some reinforcements there can only be one king of sausage town baby this is this is the original meat spin i'll tell you one thing i'm i'm not gonna be regrinding it using this old grinder now to season this thing we're gonna we're gonna keep it pretty simple because we want the taste of the yak to really shine salt black pepper garlic powder onion powder paprika powder mix it all up there pork fat and pound [Music] and just a little bit of water to this thing so that it can go through the tube a little easier days go by let the sausage hold me down would you like some yak sausage it would probably be a good idea to put casing on the tube at some point in three two one let's shush that doesn't look bad at all i'm feeling i'm i'm in a linking shorter mood how how about you i i got a good feeling that this raw yak is gonna blow so will it blow i yes it did look at that came right out of the tube it's almost like its own show you know we'll cook that up too why not well like did you you know i'm gonna give that will it blow one mark ruffalo's we're not gonna cook all these up i'm gonna cook up just a few of them so we'll get that guy and this guy we'll try those two bro you dropped your olive oil time to share these suckers and this guy too let's open them up and see how again there that certainly sausage like gives like this guy its own personal taste it's exquisite one of the most flavorful sausages that i've ever had the pleasure of making the yak meat is extremely tasty it tastes like a very clean meat i said let's forget the bun and let's just try this sausage as is so uh here we go folks this is an experience just amazing it's it's so juicy it's so flavorful i i can't get over how good it is i've never made anything this good before there's only one score that this could possibly be this is a six out of five this is this is why you get like the meat blaster 8000 instead of hand cranking these out "
