"but hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess you know ever since the aloe vera sausage I've been looking for uh looking to make a sausage that's just as refreshing and I can't think of anything more refreshing than than grass it's green it has soil we won't be sausage in the soil just the grass oh the old Mr Sausage would have you would have sausage the soil as well when trying to make some edible sausages here trying to help the world through the power of sausage you know what I don't I really don't think a knife is the right tool for this oh man it's it's when you cut it it stinks it stinks like fresh cut grass on a summer day which isn't very appetizing man I could have shaved myself a couple of bucks and just ripped out the grass from outside dogs pee on that grass and and I do for that matter as well that's a whole lot of grass I didn't think it was that much displayed in these containers well this even grind shots we don't want to do that well I got a feeling we're gonna we're gonna have to mix the park in as well I would be remiss if I didn't try a little bit of the the wheat grass juice um gross that tasted like punishment that we crass on its own tasted worse than like all of the zero out of five sausages combined get in the grasshole now we're making sausage give it a little bit more grass [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my God probably could have used one more container of this stuff you know your grass is a Fickle mistress all right looks good we're gonna we're gonna give it a stir and then we're gonna mix in uh some some spices to help us out a bit we'll give it some salt some pepper and garlic powder it already smells like Greek food now I warn you ladies I shoot from the hip I was born with a stiff stiff sausages we're gonna give that toaster oven one more chance to to do us right otherwise I'm gonna toss it out the window no no wheatgrass water and thrippy dippy doodle let's just change foreign you've come to an end Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy why do I look so sad in this but will it blow oh not not not a powerful will it Blow but it but it but it left a lasting impression yeah not not bad I'm feeling generous today so I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow to Mark ruffalo's yup 275 for an hour and a half how does that sound everyone all right we're about a third of the way done and uh you know it's chugging along what what else can I say two-thirds the way done it smells like like how a normal sausage would right now and we're done well it looks extremely unappetizing but it smells really good so uh you know let's open it up and uh see how we did grass here we go oh you know for the amount of grass in there it really doesn't taste like much the grass kind of gives it a little bit of an onion flavor but you know there's it it tastes okay it doesn't have a strong flavor uh either way actually it's kind of disappointing you know I've had sausages with just salt and pepper that have more flavor than this does it's just okay there's nothing groundbreaking here nothing tastes extreme it's just so unspectacular there's there's there's really nothing to it so I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a two and a half out of five pop up I bought everything "
