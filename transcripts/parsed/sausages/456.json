not working so we're going with Plan B now it smells like uncontrollable diarrhea and original citrus foreign how halfway done they're looking strange so good news and bad news the good news is that

sir strumming and one percent Poo-Pourri the Poo-Pourri is it is in a losing battle I mean I bleached the table so the stink is not coming from that my only guess is that I got some of the juice on the ceiling beams and if that's the case that smelling never coming out ah but uh you know let's uh well oh it's on the floor that's gonna be now our cut open sausage ew so let's uh open it up and see how we did oh there's a little bit of that fermented smell but it's not too bad all right here we go not terrible not terrible in the slightest it kind of tastes like fishy bacon there's definitely a fish gone bad aftertaste to it though we did ourselves a solid by including the pork you know I hate to see it but it's pretty good it's definitely an acquired taste it's a strong taste it tastes so right to me smoking it was absolutely the best choice to make on this one you may not believe me but it's true I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a four out of five pop [Music] "
