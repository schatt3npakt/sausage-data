"we're here there folks and welcome back i guess oh good the glucose has been removed for stability i've been saying that eggs these days have too much glucose in them equivalent to 5.3 eggs you would think they would add an additional 0.2 to make it 5.5 but that's just me well all right let's see what they look like there's what they look like without all that glucose and water in them give it a little taste test here wow it tastes just like eggs now normally i would dump the powdered eggs on there and then throw it in the grinder but this time i'm gonna mix them afterwards a boop and a boop [Music] all right let's you know mix it up a bit and then we'll throw it in the grinder for a re-grind this isn't working it's so eggy i think some of those powdered eggs entered into an open wound oh my god this could be on an episode of stranger things that's enough out of you that's ew it's so sticky it's sticky well effectively what we've done is made glue just a bit more powder there and then of course we round this out with some salt and pepper you can't have eggs without salt and pepper this is binding up real good i think a knife is the wrong choice to stir it it's it's one of the stickiest substances that that i've come across can't stop addicted to the sausage if anything comes out of this sausage tube it'll be a miracle in three two one let's shush you're kidding that yeah that's it that's all there is we're gonna give ourselves two chances here two sausages out of all that with special thanks to today's smart box hello box artist where'd you get your incident this guy it's meta it's a it's a meta mark box hello boxer box art so will it blow [Music] and almost missed them entirely so i'm gonna have to give that will it blow oh i made things much worse one and a half mark ruffalo's well all right here we go we're getting some spillage from that open end there well all right that's as cooked as i think these guys are gonna get well i know which one of these i'm gonna open up well there it is it's looking pretty pretty tasty in there if you ask me then we're gonna put the long dog in there now that's a sausage here we go it's great it's a great sausage it tastes like an omelette with with sausage in it as opposed to being a sausage with an omelette in it we did the old switcheroo if you were to put some bacon in there too i think it would round everything out it kind of just tastes like a banquet breakfast sausage i think the appropriate score for this sausage here is a 4 out of 5. wow who knew that five and a half eggs was too many "
