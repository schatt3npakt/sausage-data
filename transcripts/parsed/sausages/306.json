"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess my my confidence is is pretty high on this one that that this is gonna jam the grinder pretty pretty good you know like let's test that there and throw a couple in and and see how that goes [Music] it didn't jam it's just not it's just not going anywhere it looks like it looks like it's already been chewed so this tells me that you're mixing it with meat first is the way to go all right so let's you know let's get to it we we don't we don't we don't need quite that much and then hopefully throwing all this in the freezer will will also help break up those gumballs this spent about 30 minutes in the freezer well god that looks disgusting you know perhaps this this sausage was a mistake you want it all but you can't shosh it i wonder i wonder if i wonder if we're going to be able to blow bubbles with with this with this bubble gum sausage in three two one [Music] i checked that show that that will it blow it you know it it blitzes it it didn't it did an okay job i'm i'm gonna have to give dad will it blow two mark ruffalo's you know the box is gross all right here we go it's a it's a very strong cotton candy smell oh yeah this you know that looks pretty done to me i think we'll take it out of the pan before any bursting goes on in here it's still you know jiggly but i think that's because it's filled with gum so uh you know let's let's open it up and see how we did it looks like a juicy one i i i cut this one a little too big that's it that's a that's a foot long right there okay bubble gum sausage here we go i'm uh i'm i'm i'm i'm not quite sure how to score this because on the one hand it tastes exactly like bubble gum but on the other hand it tastes exactly like bubble gum let's really open this up there's the fun we were successful in the implementation but but but at what cost maybe this sausage is more designed for uh for a child's palette this this is not a sausage for for me it's probably not even safe to swallow to be honest with you it's it's just a little too weird for me i'm gonna i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a one out of five [Music] "
