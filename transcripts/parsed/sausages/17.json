"well hey there folks and welcome back I guess today we have one of the best appetizers ever ever created some chefs said hey I you know I bet the Americans will eat a deep-fried onion and and you know god bless them they were right and we got a whole bunch of sauce here usually they're a little bit stingy with this sauce and you know I think this is gonna make a pretty good sausage but I am worried about the the moisture level inside of the onion still I don't want to throw it through the grinder and make onion juice out of it well how did these get here this is for our sweet and sour sauce show you know what I think it's gonna be a pretty pretty decent sausage so you know let's get ready for the the king of the appetizers it's it's the bloomin onion sausage [Music] by the way if anyone wants to know when I think the sausage isn't gonna turn out right this is this is the step right here so it feels like mashed potato starting to lose hope real quick on this one you're almost out a hundred thousand you're almost out a hundred thousand it's really mashed potato II oh and by the way we do have a three different MREs coming if you're following me on Twitter yeah thank you very much I don't require any more MRE volunteers at this time well thanks to everyone who volunteered in down you know hopefully we'll have a good you will have a good show for that one ant you're here can't you hear the Thunder you better run you better take cover all aboard the sausage Express Mandy's are getting worse as we go on we got four and a quarter sausages out of that didn't I'm saying that's pretty good for one bloomin onion with sauce and these look pretty good to tell you the truth it is just mostly paste so you know it's it's you could push down on it pretty easily it's just a little jiggly but hopefully it'll harden up I don't see how there's like nothing to make it all coagulate together so this is gonna be a mess by the way I'm on patreon now all right there let's see how well this trainwreck holds up a little too hot it's a little too hot we don't want the sausages to be cooking that quickly we cooled the pan back down because that that that sausage burst in heat give it a couple of pokes here by the way if anyone wants to know this this smells the opposite of pleasant oh we got we got bursting we got we got we got bursting on all ends here all right we're gonna we're gonna get the one surviving sausage out then we'll give that one a taste test you know it takes a big man to to admit when he's wrong the only sausage that survived was one that we poked holes into so yeah I'm sorry I'm sorry to everyone who I doubt it saying that poking holes was not a good method for starch-based sausages but this guy he's one-and-a-quarter sausages so if you know sausages became one so what we'll start at this end and work our way down it's certainly a strange-looking sausage and I'm not too thrilled about trying it all right and again compliments of mrs. sausage just going wild with the props on this show yeah let's give it a little sauce almost at a hundred thousand almost at a hundred thousand oh what's that haunted Tasman now flavor-wise we have a perfect tasting bloomin onion here we messed up with the texture you know what you know what it tastes like it tastes like as if you threw a bloomin onion through a grinder it's very mushy didn't solidify at all as I predicted it wouldn't bloomin onion not not good sausage making material it just lost on the texture unfortunately I don't think that anyone would be wanting to buy this thing so this isn't the kind of sausage that we're looking for on this show we want amorous we want a more solid sausage so so bloomin onion sausage one out of five pop-pop-pop-pop I come from the land down under well women blow in manchanda can't you hear can't you hear the Thunder "
