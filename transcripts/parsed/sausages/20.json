"well hey there folks and welcome back yes to the show look at us we're well apparently we're at the ritz-carlton because we're doing a lobster more specifically lobster tail usually we have things that are already cooked that we turn into sausages in this time we're turning you know the bass meat into a sausage so the first thing we got to do is cook it real quick and get it out into an ice bath real quick here we go for the lobster sausage 1 2 3 Oh little height alright now we're gonna see how we did alright so yeah you can see it's still uncooked we were able to just kind of reach in there and grab the meat so we got a little bit of the other poop in here so we're just gonna we're gonna get rid of that there's a little bit of lobster you know these were they say there were three ounces each so this is 12 ounces so almost a pound of lobster meat here we'll see how it does in the case I'm a lot of ideas on how to turn this on so we're just gonna [Music] well that this is as close to snot that we've ever had on the program really repulsive to the touch I don't know if you can hear that but if someone said they wanted to see a water sausage so you know let's let's let's let's make that dream come true for them while there you go there's throat there's your water sausage [Music] okay that actually produced a whole lot more sausage innards then I thought it was going to now I'm going to space it out so that we don't get sausages that burst this what this would be a really expensive one to mess up on we'll make this one flatter you know let's take the extra step of boiling them first cuz I really I really want to make a good sausage out of these just look at this sausage let's get a close-up of this beautiful if this comes to this is gonna be one heck of a sausage that feels ready too shall we don't like it lobster sausage lobster sausage it that's what I'm worried about because I didn't give it too much room on the end so I hope when it expands it doesn't you know expand right out of the right out of the game I mean the whole house smells like a seafood restaurant and you know depending on whether you like seafood or not that could be a good or bet then get it in the pan and finish finish cooking it into pan theoretically because everything's cooked in there there shouldn't be anything to burst it's a it's a shame to be doing this but I think we got to cut it open and see what it looks like you know maybe not in the middle but certainly towards the top looks book to me that's entirely Lobster in that and now you've been toasted the buns for the occasion so let's let's give this a shot without any sort of condiments on it so without having to put any sort of condiments on here this is easily a five out of five this is a fantastic sausage if I do say so myself you know economically I don't know you know if you want to spend you know 30 bucks to make you know two sausages or there's a firmness to it it's got a great crunch you know we could put butter on this okay let's try it with that butter the butter actually takes away from the score it's just better on its own you know is it better than the KFC sausage no it is equal to the KFC sausage so lobster sausage five out of five bop bop-bop-bop and dad the shelves aren't going to be going the way he's gonna make lobster bisque with the shells but maybe we'll do that for the live stream I'm not sure you know because it does take a while to make that soup "
