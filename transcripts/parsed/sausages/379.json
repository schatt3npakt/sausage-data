"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess ah the soup salad and breadstick lunch from Olive Garden I admire Olive Garden for knowing that their clientele would gladly shove their faces full of breadsticks all right so let's let's see let's see what's all in here well of course we have we have the salad that comes with a generous amount of tomatoes and and other stuff and then we're gonna add the greatest soup known to man that the chicken gnocchi soup right on top of it all right and we got one breadstick two breadsticks and six we're gonna need all that bread to soak up all this liquid oh shoot I forgot the dressing no problem we can add that right now there there we go can't forget the croutons either a pack of of Romano cheese and an Andy's meant to balance it all out there now we're good oh crud right on the floor ah [Music] I love the liquor oh there's all the liquid that's been building up really it looks like a pretty delicious chopped salad it's it's a wet one all right for sure this is getting baked there's no way this will hold up in a pan for more than five seconds [Music] [Music] that's a lot of sausage feeling three two one let's Shaw Shake we don't want thick sausages so we're gonna pull this along so we make nice thin ones and that's gonna be that not bad these sausages burst while baking when we link them so we're not gonna link this one and see what happens Which special thanks to today's Mark box a little box artist this guy it's a it's an infinite Ruffalo a cosmic infinite Ruffalo but will it blow oh no no no no no no pretty good spray good stickage I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow for Mark ruffalos I'm thinking wait we gotta go low and slow on this one bake it at 300 for 45 minutes we're a little more than halfway done and things are moving along pretty good she on another 20. all right we're almost done here and uh oh we got a rupture in the back I even see that we got a burst it still doesn't feel done so I'm gonna let it ride for another 15 minutes all right let's see how we did well besides this one big burst area you know everything else seems to have come out fine well we packed it in lotion boy is this one limpy sausage all right well let's uh let's open it up see how we did it smells like potato soup okay here we go it's very good this is a really delicious sausage sausage as you can see the biggest problem with this sausage is is the mush factor it's it's very mushy I don't know what amount of baking will cause this to to solidify but we bake this for an hour and we got like a like a like a burst 20 minutes in it has a mashed potatoey interior I'm not gonna lie basically it tastes like you dipped your your garlic bread and soup with pieces of salad in it it tastes as fresh as the Tuscan Sun and even though it is mushy it's not pouring out of there it's it's staying firm well inside there I'm pushing pretty dang hard and it's not coming out for me easily this is a four out of five for someone else eating this sausage I think it may be a little bit too mushy for them I'm sure sure we won't give it exactly a forward we're gonna we're gonna give that sausage here a three and a half out of five [Music] all right so I I think it's best if we just cram it all in "
