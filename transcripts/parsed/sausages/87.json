could do interpretations of drink sausage um kevin king squirrel meat sausage i i don't know where we could get that um backyard i guess we'd have to shoot it ourselves cook the diseases out of it um senor spoon 64. can you say senor spoons let's sausage send your spoons let's just edge felix sosa studies barbecue sausage sweet tea included i might do that just because to piss off the barbecue people oh it's singing to me that's that singing tells me it's ready um [Music] what a stupid dum-dum oh right at the finish line horrible small have you considered any other kinds of cooking methods like perhaps smoking or barbecue uh yeah yes i have so we've done a grill episode and that was really fun uh it's just that i'm not accustomed to cooking outside i i've always cooked indoors so cooking outside will be a a new uh adventure for me because we have a smoker that's something we could easily do where's my knife um happy hippo eaters you should also make a baseline sausage sausages too all right well internally i know what a what a sausage should should taste like you know what this popped right in the center that's fine daffodil s'more sausage for camping season is it camping

flavors as you as you all well know um i i like this this is uh this is to me this is like uh i'm wavering it's it's like it's a three but i also want to give it a four but i know people people overall would probably rate it a three but personally i think it's a four so i'm going to do that i'm going to give this a 4. i think this is a great job this is this is a four out of five four out of five and it's harder than hell mr shots and chippy you got one on the screen you can read oh i shall lord uh match chuck uh did you see any sausage halloween costumes this year love your content uh

like a sloppy joe though like an asian sloppy joe agent like a um i i think it's a three yeah that's what i said so my personal preference leaned it towards a four even though i know most people would rate it a three so uh yeah me personally i think it's a four mr sausage says it's a three officially it's going down on the books it's a four um sack dragger no that's good i like that that's a good
