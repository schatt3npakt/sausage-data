i'm going to give this for but sam i'd like to hear what you would give this my score for this sausage is gonna be the hanukkah miracle itself five five that's gonna be my score wow a five out of five five out of five right out of the gate i myself uh am almost in agreement with uh uh sam it has a lovely consistency it has a sausage-like consistency it uh has a lovely crunch and it also tastes like latkes so what what what what what more do you want flavor-wise i think it could you could have used a little apple sauce it could have used a little shower cream maybe i'm still going to give this sausage here a 4 out of 5.
