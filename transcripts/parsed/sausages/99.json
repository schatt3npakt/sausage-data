"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess we got this beautiful piece of a new zealand red deer here that i i bought online and then there it is and as for ingredients we're gonna keep it real simple with some onion some pepper salt coriander a little bit of cumin and some garlic cloves okay so the first thing we should probably do is cube this up that's a beautiful color on this i think we should probably introduce a little bit of fat we're going to include some fat back into this so that the sausage isn't going to be so dry all right it's it's time to grind this up this may be the first time the grinder's been used for its intended purpose [Music] does everybody know what time it is it's regrind time [Applause] so can you feel the love tonight tonight what what the hell are you doing singing's my thing it's a love song i can't have mrs sausage screwing it up in three two one let's sausage what did i say what did i say i just thought it applies for everything well you know what we probably could have made links it's not too late here we'll we'll link these bad boys up how about that well there you go you got you got five sausages out of there all right yeah let's let's go ahead and tr try one of these bad boys okay so that means that it's time to it's it's time to taste the sausage but first we have uh some fan mail to open it's a it's a lovely decal from uh from cody from kentucky cody suggests that this can be a place done a grinder or a stuffer uh maybe one of those objects so i think that will absolutely do that joe you know i decided to flare it up uh so so that's what i did so let's uh let's uh let's go ahead and eat it it's it's a fantastic sausage well one because i made it the sausage is a little bit drier than i would have liked it to have been uh we could have put in a little bit more fat back in order to to make it not so dry i mean it's not it's not a desert uh the onions are a fantastic compliment to it i mean onions are a great compliment to any sausage so that that's that's that's neither here nor there putting a little bit more fat into this then it would be the perfect sausage because of that slight error on my part i'm going to have to give this shawshank a a a a four and a half out of five pop pop i'm gonna try to apply this decal as as good as i can here mr sausage isn't known for his decal putting on i think we did a pretty good job on that we got a customized uh grinder now "
