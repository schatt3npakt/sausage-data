"we're here there folks and uh welcome back I guess back to back frozen meals but after the Fiasco of of the Guy Fieri flavor Town sloppy joe mac and cheese I figured that these could use a Redemption

Gordon Ramsay's risotto mushrooms white wine and parmesan cheese these are located just above the flavor Town frozen meals I got a good feeling about it if it's from Chef Ramsay It's gotta be good and

sausage here we go it tastes like um microwaved rice and and mushroom soup if you look up those two ingredients together you'll find out that that costs less than six dollars uh not a good sausage not a good frozen meal not worth six dollars actually twelve it costs twelve dollars to make this one sausage you know when it comes to these things I have to think does it taste better than the cat food sausage and I'm really really struggling to think that it does you know I I'm gonna give it half a point better than guy Fanny because I just don't like that guy so I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a two and a half out of five pop they have the Guy Fieri they got the Gordon Ramsay and they also have the guy from Bizarre Foods I didn't look at what he was selling but if it's like monkey testicles and frog eyebrows then I'd I'd be willing to give that one a shot "
