"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i really guess i can't think of anything more scarier than you know eating the the the twigs and berries of the ball uh a slam dunk for the halloween episode i think so there's the there's they call it the puzzles which i have no problem calling that the puzzles and over here we have a bull freeze created you know it's it's it's the intimate parts of the bowl sausage this looks more like heart than the heart episode but you know it's balls and this isn't the first time that i've had a bull penis in my hand bombs away oh that they they always cling to the side one for you and one for me you know one's always larger than the other [Applause] see you later fellas [Music] [Applause] oh my god it's doing it [Music] wow it was strong enough to to stop the machine okay now we know you have to you have to chop the penis up may god forgive me for this episode i'm gonna i'm gonna do this like salt bae okay i mean you sprinkle the the the penis there's certainly uh some sort of fight some some reinforcements twice the penis is just too strong for the machine i'm a creep i'm a weirdo all right we're gonna hit this with a little bit of salt pepper some onion some garlic in three two one let's sausage okay and that's that's all we got out of there i'm i'm gonna need years of therapy after this will it blow and i don't feel like cleaning up pieces of testicle all over my kitchen but i do it for the love of the show so here we go will it blow damn i just cleaned it up too why did i clean it up when i knew i was going to do this [Music] good luck boys take a take a peek at uh at the goods uh you know it looks like a pretty good uh chicken sausage or maybe yeah lately this looks like a chicken sausage to me i know what i have to do but i don't know if i have the strength to do it all right so uh here we go uh this is uh you know it's it's actually okay uh this is the first time that i've ever had it before so i didn't know what to expect but the taste to me tastes like a mixture between chopped liver and chicken and uh dare i say it this even though it looked you know like pure liquid when it came out of the grinder this this could have gone another grind up in there but you know for not having know what the heck we were doing uh you this this turned out pretty good it's not obviously going to get a great score but i think for being a a a an out of left field sausage it's a pretty good score of uh of a 2 out of 5. you know this this episode has backfired so badly on me like the amount of sympathy pain i'm having right now but this is what we do for our craft "
