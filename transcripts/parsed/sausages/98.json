let me know allow me to don't want to do it and mrs sausage spit it right out you didn't like it i loved it i thought it was great what didn't you like about it mrs sausage there's a paper towel right here mrs sausage so to me it tastes good it tastes like it tastes like uh uh it has a solid gingerbread crunch to it that's what i like about it well i did maybe you just pulled all the juice out to the front and like scraped it with your teeth instead of taking a good bite so it had the solid gingerbread core to it which i loved i love that thing and the the the sugar uh uh it caramelized uh and it tasted like a roasted marshmallow almost the the the downside is well you could you can just see how how mushy this this bad boy is it probably would have tasted bad before it went to the sausage into the casing or the grinder i don't think so mrs sausage doesn't have quite the sweet tooth as mr sauce is just are you missing any doughnuts i'm trying to get the taste out of my mouth it's good no it's not i'm gonna have to give this ah you know the mush the mush is a factor so here's the thing we screwed up by putting in the eggnog oh that's what that so that's where we went wrong we didn't have to put the eggnog in the the frosting uh lubed it up enough huh negative one i'm gonna have to give this sausage a three out of five yes a three out of five it's like a negative no it tastes it tastes better than funnel cake i don't buy that it it i it has a very nice and plus the little candies that are all in there that's very pleasant look at it it like it burst i know it burst but did
