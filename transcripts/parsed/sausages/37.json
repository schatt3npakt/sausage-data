"well hey there folks and welcome back I guess to another episode I'll pop up a pop up a pop up a buh buh buh buh buh all right so we're doing we're doing our orange chicken redo episode you know the sausage Lords they chose a honey shrimp or honey not shrimp honey nut cheerios shrimp well but we'll maybe do like three sausages one that sister ones chicken one that's just honey shrimp and then one that's a combination of both of them shall I orange chicken redo sausage plus honey honey shrimp sausage as well to be honest with you guys these look pretty similar this is the orange chicken as as we well know the honey nut cheerios shrimp texturally you know they have that same kind of crunchiness to it but the sauces is a lot heavier on the orange chicken than it is on it on the shrimp here [Music] these looked so much the same that you're not going to know which one is which so I've devised a system in which we can identify them we'll say for the shrimp we'll use shrimp shrimp blue green is the universal symbol for shrimp and chicken it don't don't be afraid to use your hands either everyone knows that red and chicken are the artists that are the key ingredients - oh well that just that just kind of looks like blood and I can still feel the heat of the chicken you know I would say out of all of them that you know red was you know the biggest mistake first the first layer I want to do is chicken then we're going to do the chicken and shrimp followed by you know that yeah this is perfect silence how much that cut the foot the kuva food coverings coming off on on the on the on the casing itself three two one let's charge oh yeah that's that that's the one that's the one well you know what what what a monstrosity we've made here it looks like clown gore this could you know this I feel could be on batching with BIM bish oh well there that's a burst well we had some some some winners and some losers we have loved this guy Paul you know 80% of the audience felt that one we did get three survivors which is all we need cuz we have chicken chicken and shrimp we have you know mostly it's mostly shrimp so well yeah we did all right so here we go just the chicken chicken is actually very good it's very sweet orange chicken is going to get a revised score of a three out of five and I will try the shrimp and chicken well you can you can kind of taste the honey in the shrimp starting here but unfortunately of the breading on the shrimp does what it what wedding always does and it mutes the other flavors so so it has left taste in the chicken sausage so did this one that I would get like like a 2 out of 5 they're not just the shrimp sausage this one looks like it's been in a fire but here we go yeah the breading the breading is just totally just a dominating the shrimp I can't I can't see I can barely taste any shrimp so just the shrimp on itself I would give that one a 1 out of 5 this was just you know for the orange chicken redo so we'll just say that the score is a a 3 out of 5 Papa Papa why do people love you "
