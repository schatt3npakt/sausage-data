"well we're we're charlie we're we're sort of back today we're here for a specific purpose that purpose is to have a cookout and then sausage the cookout and then try the sausage cookout it's so hot out here and uh why do we live here charlie why do we live in florida it's a beautiful land where dreams come true there's no good reason to live here it's like a furnish we're gonna get cooking here the marshmallows look like they're cooking on their own in there we have our hamburger patties we also have these special sausages he has no idea what these are right he just knows that i made them i also know they've been sitting out for like an hour now they've been sitting they were free frozen we did drop a couple of things on the way in too we got a coney island uh hot dogs these are really warm these were this might need to go in there this is a this is a code right that's more cooked than it is cold now you're going to be doing us a disservice have you ever had grilled corn before oh yeah well good because this one's just as hot as the hot dogs from sitting out in the sun for over an hour before we decided to shoot this though i say i say i could i could smell the gas leaking from here charlie i'm feeling it i'm feeling the cookout you know well you will take one of these just slap it on the grill right we're gonna slap it on the grill well you know what they say about hamburgers you get you already broke it my burger's gonna be a superstar it's already coming along nicely oh baby that sounded good here we'll put these right up there yeah just enough heat up there i think have you ever bit into an onion oh the the sasha just fell off oh no it's great it's i guess it's cooking and make sure to get b-roll of charlie leaving too there we go we got some corn on the cob here kelly i just want to show another magic trick can i just drop it oh it's going well in there it's going about as well as our thanksgiving episode charlie no this is somehow much worse do we have a fire extinguisher because this corn i'm gonna have to throw this on the ground after you know oh my god the hot dogs are ready i'm gonna try this hot dog she's good i can tell it's a little charred we got we got to start we got to start prepping uh the uh immune system we gotta we gotta start thinking about how we're gonna sausage all this one of us charlie forgot their grinder we're gonna be using this black and decker chopper this is what guy calls flavor town the best part is that the corn is absolutely not oh that's just on fire yeah why don't you load me up with some bugs yeah with some hot dogs yeah that's good and then it goes right in you want me to flip one in here i'll flip the chunk there we go and good work oh that one's burned that's good butterfly oh all right i'm gonna do behind the back oh that was cool that was very cool you don't want me to throw it no i agree here's some pickles definitely want like a big onion in there just so you know and we got grilled corn i don't think so everything's disgusting that'll work we'll just make floor sausages instead oh it was so promising so we're gonna we're gonna sausage dish in in the back room and uh show here we go that looks that looks good enough for me it stinks oh it stinks every barbecue he's got to have some mana chevitch dishes this has been sitting in the hot sun for two hours that's when wine really gets to its best that's my favorite kind all right cheers well here's our the the work take a good whiff of that start the girl back up oh i just missed entirely hope you're gonna hose this table down when you're done with it they've been cooling for about half an hour so the flavors really sealed in oh i forgot you were supposed to taste one of those sausages that hooks up to the the casing but we're going to give it our best shot anyway got to rinse this out too you got a bathroom we can rinse this use the wine oh it's a salty adventure look how the water's pooling at the bottom oh i thought you were gonna hold on to it well that's pretty good we got it a little bit wrenched we are trying to figure out a pretty big misstep here if you don't have a your sausage plastic uh stuffing tube you gotta figure out how to sausage without it we're rogue sausaging in three two one lit shawshedge i think it's working wait no it broke it broke it's not working it's not working look all we need is just one piece to try we're going to call this our sausage right here fruits of our effort right here that's beautiful that side's not on i thought it couldn't get any worse with the thanksgiving episode i always saved charlie for the good one all right you have a plate to the untrip i want some bacon i made all of it i'm feeling pretty ill i'll pull it off first purely for you guys and now a quarter of a sausage all right there you go cheers i taste hand sanitizer nope wow i give it a one you're gonna give it a one is it really that bad take like the most burnt thing you could imagine and then fill it in a gross casing that was the worst tasting sausage that i've ever tasted oh come on man let's go matt good bite there's something cooking in the back that's a raw onion yes there is a lot of those in there charlie that was that was a zero out of five you gave it a one out of five because you are you're you're uh you're you're a you're a saint it's just there's so much passion put into that uh what's it called uh uh uh uh uh not a pessimist the opposite optimist an optimist i i apologize on behalf of uh sausage makers everywhere but charlie look we got we got some fan mail yeah yeah we got it let's see what we got here today oh there's a little little sausage oh that's actually really cool so thank you uh micah so there it is charlie thanks again for helping of course helping me make one of the worst sausages no i'm gonna go and say it that was the worst sausage that i've ever had on the show we encountered a lot of obstacles today and we found the optimal solutions at each impasse this is why i don't grill well i'm gonna give it a zero out of five and charlie's gonna give it a that's a one a one out of five with a combined score of half a point can you guess what it is tastes like a sausage mixed with a sausage and then another sausage that's exactly what it is it's six johnsonville sausages "
