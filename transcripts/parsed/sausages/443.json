"we're here there folks and uh welcome back yes all right so first things first I was just gonna do swordfish sausage but that seemed a little bit boring so we're gonna add some corn and asparagus to it that is frozen solid experiment oh that actually took care of that pretty easily this time I was hoping the grinder would jam so that I could do a big reveal yeah Papa's Got a Brand New grinder and it's huge the good people that meet your maker reached out to me and said look you're embarrassing yourself so they sent me their Mack Daddy of all Grinders it's also foot pedal operated I still think you made your maker for sending that out to me I'm sure I'll find a way to break it though now look I've never cooked swordfish in my life but I assume it's just the same thing as as normal fish foreign foreign enough here to make a pretty decent sausage isn't that I'm in the afternoon your eyes are the size of a sausage sing it with me now in three two one let's Shaw said okay Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy that is some talented work right there I was convinced it was really me so how about a game will it blow that's a good blow that's a good solid blow and it went to several places so I'm gonna have to get down will I blow four four ruffalos here we go yeah I think it's done let's open it up and see how we did a citrus thing here we go it's pretty good the fish is a little dry we shouldn't have you know cooked it fully but you know it's not it's not really mushy it's not solid either it's it's it's a little mushy I think the asparagus was the wrong choice of vegetable to put in here the corn is good but the asparagus is is a little too bitter I think green beans maybe would have been better so I'm gonna have to give this sausage here like three and a half out of five pop [Music] "
