"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess oh we got a Clinger a big bucket of Auntie Anne's pretzel bites they're going they're salty they're buttery God I hope that's butter and we're gonna turn it into a sausage you know I don't think they specify how many of these pretzel bites there are what do you say we count them one one two three this is gonna be a long video 4 50 86 and 87 pretzel bites I thought there would have been at least a hundred but you know I'm the sucker for spending 46 dollars on this that's including these cheeses though how you doing Mr Cheese wow that's a that's a whole lot of cheese missing that's a big air pocket of cheese I'm not sure if that's enough cheese to to actually do anything to all these pretzels all right let's give it a taste test how are they still in business I'm debating whether or not to add the cheese mix now or after because I I really don't think that the cheese will grind well but uh you know let's let's see what happens you gotta be kidding me I think the cheese is gonna need to act as a lubricant okay come on you pretzel oh it's on my arm oh we did oh we gotta transfer hi yep oh it's still warm wait a second now that's thinking with your noodle [Music] we're gonna scrape out some of this cheese and really really get our money's worth out of this I'm reserving one for dunking but I still haven't found the sausage I'm looking for and this one ain't gonna be it oh I put the thick tube on this one normally when it comes to bread we don't we don't like thick sausages but I really think low and slow in the toaster oven has been our Saving Grace for a multitude of sausages that's that's the pretzel water in three two one let's Shawshank it's gonna be a tough sausage it's almost like eating the replit Applebee's it's working slowly but surely without all that cheese we would we this thing would not have come out of the tube it's coming over the sides all right I I can't I can't turn it anymore I think we've reached the End by the way if the CEO of Auntie Anne's is watching this and all of a sudden you start selling these pretzel sausages I'm gonna Sue it's so solid I'm afraid to cook it anyway Which special thanks to today's Mark boxello box artist this guy this lack of a will it Blow is sponsored by Helix sleep Helix sleep the makers of Premium mattresses and betting to fit your specific sleep needs you love to sleep Helix wants to help you sleep why do you push away those that are trying to help you most I've had my Helix mattress for well over two years and it's the gift

gonna get it out of there what if we okay we're giving ourselves a handicap so it did manage to blow with only 10 of it left I'm gonna ruffalo's with an asterisk if I can get this Puck out in one piece I'm gonna eat it words of failing come to me you Puck of deliciousness oh yeah we're gonna fry this up and eat it oh we're gonna turn the heat down and burned on the other side as well come on [Music] okay we're gonna put this on the lowest setting yet we've done for sausages we'll do 250 for 30 minutes all right we're a little over there halfway mark I'm gonna add 15 more minutes to it smells like an Auntie Anne's in there well all right let's open it up and see how we did oh that looks flavorless here we go um we reserve that cheese oh yeah all right here we go again oh yeah that cheese is where it's at we're gonna fix this sausage all right here here we go again well that cheese is this sausage is Saving Grace without it it's pretty plain it kind of it sort of tastes like a pretzel but it mostly tastes like bread and of course we can't forget about the puck ah that puck tastes like a slightly burnt pancake I personally believe that with that we just had the the ratios wrong we should have had more cheese per pretzel bite you know that's on me but you know they they only sell them in packs of six uh so without the cheese this sausage would be like a two out of five with the cheese I'm gonna have to pump that number up to a three and a half out of five this is like a one pop with all that changed now it uh you know that really that really turns this sausage into uh something edible "
