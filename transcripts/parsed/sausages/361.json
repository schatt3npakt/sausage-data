"well hey there folks and welcome back thank you I am one angry potato today this you can clearly see is not pork butt it's pork roast that's not how you make a sausage they were all at a pork butt at the grocery store and they outright refused to go look in the back to see if there was more I know there's not any more in the back you know there's not any more in the back but you still go look just in case I saw this veal breast and I was like well maybe that'll even things out we're gonna blend these two We're Not Gonna use all of it because if this turns out to be a disaster I don't want to throw out all that sausage and it probably will be a disaster knowing this show so this sausage is going to be made entirely of of of MSG you know it would be better if if it was made you know Park but that would that would obviously be helpful to this whole situation the guy just looked at me was like no no we don't have it didn't even handed me there's our veal there's our wrong cut of pork he didn't even say why don't you try our other story The Man hi this this thing needs to be sharpened look how incorrect this park is half of the pork and the other half of the sausages is gonna be the veal really we're halfway to making a bratwurst is there bone this is duller than a butter knife at this point this thing can't even cut refrigerated oh there is bone in there hey if your knife's not sharp why do you keep using it mind your business whatever happened to sorry sir we're all out of pork butt but we're expecting a shipment of Newport but uh on on Tuesday so come back on Tuesday and we'll have your fresh but none of that how dare I the customer ask for something that they sell hey Jimmy you'll never guy asked me if we had park fights I showed him the door and it's not like I went at 12 o'clock at night I went at nine in the morning you know when they stock the shelves but anyway this episode's not called the the gripes with Mr Sausage it's it's we're supposed to be making MSG sausage the best way we know how well not maybe not the best way yeah that thing is jammed with fat we possibly heard in our judgment let's see what all the problem is that would be it let this be a lesson to you to properly have your your your sausage Parts Frozen before you toss them in the grinder otherwise you're going to end up with this well like I I I can tell you one thing about this sausage that the texture is gonna be off it's monosodium glutamate time now I'm not really sure you know how much is is too much here but you know we're we're here to we're here to make something special I should invest in a pair of disposable gloves if you would have called the store ahead of time you would have saved yourself a trip shout out that's enough out of you not gonna call the store for something that they sell on the regular ah yes do you do you sell food at your store you got food there today I mean missing sausage back me up on this I mean I've been telling you to buy it in bulk when you see it in the store buy a month's worth so you don't have to keep going back five times a week so when they don't have it it doesn't matter you don't have to ask run around looking for pork butt you just have the pork butt on hand shout out I mean you've never worked retail no but you have yeah when I worked in the deli we were understaffed and you have people coming to you constantly asking for if you have something in stock you're right it's my fault for questioning the people who work there who are always right about everything it's your fault for not listening to me all right all right dude you want to make this sausage or not no in three two one let's shush [Music] okay ah the perfect amount of casing kids strikes again God it reminds me of the all pork fat sausage get your butt back there and find my pork butt which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy wow back-to-back submissions implying that I do massive amounts of cocaine what kind of Vibes am I giving off I swear it's nothing but coffee and sausages but will it blow you can see how fatty it is based on how it sticks I've always I've always maintained that position so I'm gonna have to give that will a blow three Mark Ruffles here we go these sausages are giving off an unpleasant Aroma they smell like the inside of a Halloween mask all that fat and the sausage dripped out in the pan and kind of messed up our sear here so these are some funky looking sausages but let's open one of these up and see how we did oh it felt behind the table it looks like a fatty one okay here we go um well of course we knew that the texture was going to be all wrong on this sausage and so it is supports extra chewy that that could even be the veal that's causing all that chew who who knows uh taste wise there's nothing Magnificent about this sausage it kind of tastes like we dropped a beef bouillon cube in there that's that's the vibe I'm getting off this sausage really it's not a flavor issue the flavor is kind of it's kind of it's okay there's it's it's nothing spectacular it's the texture that's all wrong uh so had this have been made with with with pork butt and the texture was right inside I would give that sausage like uh like a three and a half out of five the texture is really that bad it's like chewing on a softball basically uh so I'm gonna have to give this particular sausage here a two out of five pop you know you're a fool for asking for a pork bite that's that's the notion that I was able to get from that guy "
