"well top of the morning to you folks it's st. Patrick's Day since it is I figured we do a traditional st. Patrick's meal a corned beef and cabbage that's pretty much it we also got some Guinness here to add some flavor to it boil the sausages and the Guinness give it a little something extra this one's probably the closest we've ever gone to a normal sausage here so it I'm betting this one's gonna turn out pretty good and this is actually one of the easier foods that you can make all you got to do is get the corned beef out of the packaging sometimes that's easier said than done save this little packet and dump it right on in actually going to want to put this fat side down [Music] well one of these don't hurt no reason not to finish these off hey hey everybody its mr. potato sausage mr. potato sausage piling up tequila if you know maybe maybe we don't drink tequila on the show anymore well there at all these folks and I gotta tell you this looks pretty good it looks like a corned beef hash I mean that's what it is and it still tastes like corned beef and it's got a little bit of the sweetness from the cabbage I'm still I'm still thinking this is going to be a pretty decent sausage here well this is it's a whole lot wetter inside of the other than I thought it would be so I'm getting kind of nervous I'm not really sure what went wrong here does it there's a whole lot of liquid going on all right we're gonna have to try to fix this a post sausage all right I guess this is the moment of truth we didn't have some problems making this sausage so hopefully it goes better in the pan looking pretty good folks looking pretty good that looks pretty good to me that looks like sausage this little guy I tried boiling first but as you can see most of the meat fell out of it that looks downright delicious if you if you want to ask me all right there they are folks we have the one that was beer battered and then we have the one that was we just prayed to get it out of the pan safely and we did a good job let's start with this one okay now this one in case you haven't guessed it already this is a five out of five sausage here it's got everything you need it tastes exactly like a corned beef sandwich with a little bit of cabbage in there for you and it is fantastic I can't stress that enough it totally keeps the flavor if I did have to put any criticism towards it is that maybe I shouldn't have cooked it so much in the beginning so that it wasn't so crumbly as you can see so so maybe don't cook it as long so that it makes a more solid sausage and of course the one that's beer-battered you have that you have that Guinness flavor still in there I could take it either or be about it or not this is a 5 out of 5 pop pop pop little public service announcement maybe not for this yet because we're all quarantined and whatnot but des if you are going to go out and enjoy the st. Patrick's Day festivities you know remember to drink responsibly and if you have too many you know call a cab or an uber but never drink and drive "
