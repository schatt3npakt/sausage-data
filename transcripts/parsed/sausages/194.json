"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess we're doing our lamb chops uh today and that's that that will be the sausage that we make we're also gonna be making a parsley garlic sauce just to make it a little bit more interesting i certainly hope eight are enough to make at least one sausage because if not then we're you know where we where we're in trouble show it's the lamb chops sausage we're gonna knock out the sauce first by balling up a bunch of parsley and just go into town on it really minch it up good then we're gonna load up our garlic press and be thoroughly disappointed in the amount that comes out scrape off as much as you can now clog those arteries and salt and pepper your way to flavor town population parsley stir it up and then set it to the side for later next fumble your way through the plastic wrap on your lamb chops until you break the styrofoam container and then add plenty of salt because you know it's just gonna go straight into the grinder and add plenty of pepper for the very same reason add a ton of olive oil to the pan and start laying the lamb chops out cook them on one side for three minutes and then flip you're gonna also cook the other side for three minutes but while that's going hey it's the remnants of the garlic we crush chuck it right on in okay looks done let's get them out onto the plate and ignore the garlic we burned now lovingly spoon your sauce around your lamb chops in a vain attempt to make it look classy and when that fails just plop it all over because you know it's going right into the grinder now taste the fruit of your labor by cutting into a lamb chop and then taking a bite of said lamb chop well that's that's a bit of terrific i i don't think yeah i think we should not try anymore because we need you know as much of this meat as we as we can get so let's uh you know let's let's let's grind it you know it would probably make more sense to remove the bones first and ever so gently we just all of it there we go uh you know i'd i'd feel a whole lot better about this if we did a regrind it shall shine that the shashi jaina rise up that's the lamb water three two one let that we we got enough for uh for a pretty big sausage and will it blow will it blow it it does not blow zero mark ruffalo's all right so here we go again we have no choice but to see how we did that's all right just a tip well it it looks like a like a delicious sausage but looks looks can be deceiving that's looking a little intimidating all right so here we go taste wise this is a a dynamite sausage however the the skin uh didn't didn't get uh crispy it's it's still you know typically you don't want that kind of you don't want this much flexi in your sausage but taste wise it's a real knockout that that parsley sauce really really complements it well so i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a four out of five i i think in your shine that the sausage in our eyes are mirror images and when we kissed they're perfectly aligned "
