"we're headed folks and uh welcome back I guess don't you remember running downstairs on Christmas Day and seeing a whole bunch of presents underneath the tree and the smell of your mother's chicken heart cooking has has filled the air god that's a lot of chicken did I need to buy two bags of this and see each bag is is is one pound and I probably I probably could have gotten away with just one bag well I mean there it is I mean it's it's a whole lot more easier to deal with than those beef Hearts you want to talk about nightmares that that is that is one for the books ah so it it doesn't look so bad it looks ventrically actually that one looks pretty ventrically they look pretty lean they're they're pretty muscular so hopefully it won't be too dry hopefully this little bit of fat on top will be enough to to keep things juicy I really gotta stop pouring out all the ingredients pleasure of seeing the balut sausage episode worse or better reminds me I need to get my oil changed it really boggles the mind how many chickens had to die to make this sausage so we'll hit it with salt and of course pepper of course garlic powder we'll clean that up nicely onion powder and we'll throw a curve ball in with some cayenne pepper it's raining sausage hallelujah it's raining sausage which I guess that is what that song's about [Music] I'm gonna make these extra plumpy I I don't think these will burst and that about does our oh look we got a little special boy here so there you have it two pounds of chicken hearts will get you roughly four sausages by the way congratulations to the person who got selected for this will it Blow it's gonna be a doozy by the way these chicken hearts have been pretty Pleasant to deal with Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy that's some good Mr Sausage pixel art but will it Blow Gap yo it keeps going pretty good I knew it was gonna be a good one so I'm gonna have to give that will it blow out for Mark ruffalos and for those of you saying that should have been a five expect more from your will it blows it's supposed to be a mushroom whatever here we go [Music] oh my God oh my God all right they're they're probably done that was a whole lot of unanticipated heart juice and we'll open up this little guy looks it actually looks dry even though it's dripping okay here we go well that's certainly an interesting flavor it tastes a little bit like chicken mostly it's the texture that's throwing me off it is it is springy it's a mix of chicken and organs it's I mean it's a heart so why wouldn't it taste like an organ but it does it it has a very distinct organy flavor to it it was only two dollars per bag so if you're gonna make sausage this is a pretty good this is a pretty cheap way to do it the skin is not crispy it is Gummy there was a surprising amount of heart juice still left in those hearts so all that being said I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a two and a half out of five pop [Music] "
