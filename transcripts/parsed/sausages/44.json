"you know we're not at a million yet we're not going to be showing mr sausage's face uh just yet a lot of people are upset that the friday shows uh don't include uh uh well hey there folks but if you want me to do the hey there folks i'll do the hey there for folks on the friday ones as well also uh people have been saying that they that they want they want more than a minute from the friday show in order to increase the length of the friday shows uh because uh let me tell you something there's not much content there with the sausages that we're making on the friday show in order to make it longer i felt that we would include a bit for the fan art unboxing i just realized i need a knife for this this uh fan art is from uh at rls photogenic on twitter so if you like what you see here uh you know go ahead and say on twitter hey i like i like i like the goods oh a little bop bop bop letter they even wax stamped it i feel so elegant i feel like i need a candelabra while we unbox this i'm gonna look at it first i think i think these people know what they're doing this was very well packed so yeah here it is how about that people we're gonna put it on our temporary wall which is you know the kitchen wall once the sausage studio goes up uh we'll be able to uh hang up all these wonderful pieces of artwork in sausage studios and so it shall be all right now for the main event well that certainly smells like bacon someone in the comments said that they missed uh you know the bit where i turned the machine on so here you go guys sausage we're just gonna feed it right on in and wait for it to grab [Music] basically what we did was just we re we made spam kill me so i basically have zero faith that this that you know that going in raw in the casing is going to turn out well so i'm going to cook half of it in the pan and do the other half raw and then we'll see which one turns out better we could have just skipped this part and just done baker bits that looks like one cooked uh cooked bacon image to me [Music] all right we got three sausages uh to be uh sausage here we got the pre-cooked bacon we got the raw bacon and we got the air sausage i doubt we need any more oil but it couldn't hurt we'll just throw them right on in oh oh jesus we are the rogers oh god well that couldn't have gone any worse we're gonna we're gonna try the the cooked bacon sausage and uh uh until next time raw bacon sausage uh you win this time it's it's it's super salty it's super chewy you spend the entire time chewing on it it tastes like bacon and i would like a rematch later with uh with the raw bacon so one out of five you know what some of this did manage to actually uh stick together so much worse than the cup sausage zero out of five "
