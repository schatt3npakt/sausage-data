"well hey there folks and welcome back i guess today where we're doing uh the hungry man uh chalice chalice berry i've always pronounced it salisbury steak but uh clearly it's salisbury it's this it's the hungry man salisbury sausage we'll do a small taste test uh before we go in the grinder so you see what we're dealing with here it's um uh certainly not my favorite um frozen meal green beans are pretty good though and the mashed potatoes aren't bad either but the salisbury steak i would say needs a lot of improvement oh well well it looks like baby food i'm sure once it's actually cooked it may actually look quite uh delicious so uh you know let's let's get to the stuffing climbing up on shellsbury hill i could see the sausage lights grab your things i've come to bring you sausages in three two one let's [Music] oh i wonder what we could possibly do with this thing we'll just put them in there and yeah while we weren't paying attention this one uh unspiraled into one long one so uh yeah it's okay we still have our one solid link here we got a burst going on here but uh i'm just gonna let that do its thing and uh yeah see what happens it's amazing this thing will not stop spilling out this is a sad moment for this show it's obvious to me there's no end in sight of this thing just oozing itself out so let's just get it out of there you disappoint me in more ways than i could possibly explain why didn't you solidify all right this is uh a sad episode this this should have solidified and it didn't got a wonderful crisp on the skin but you know just look how mushy it is in there all right let's see let's let's give it a shot it is it is unreasonably hot i'm guessing that's because of all the water from the green beans and probably why this thing didn't solidify the green beans gave it too much water it has a it has a decent taste to it you know it's it's still out it burst out together we probably should have run it through the grinder a second time this is an upsetting episode to me i i feel i'm feeling pretty bummed out about this one i'm going to give this a a two out of five buh there's there's so many steps in this i it's unbelievable and then we cook it for an additional four minutes oh you're supposed to recover this mess i threw the cover out this whole thing's going sideways "
