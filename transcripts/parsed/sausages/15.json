"well hey there folks and welcome back to a normal episode of the sausage show and those of you who are the MRE fans of the show you may be saying hey this is this is yet another episode that isn't the MRE episode so some news about that the post office yeah they had they they went ahead and they lost that package but you know these are a difficult time so we're not gonna hold it against them the guy who sent me the MRE he didn't want any public recognition all he wanted in return was a raise awareness for autism charities he doesn't mention a specific one but if you know of an autism charity that you would like to donate to please do so if you have a MRE that you think would be good to sausage on the show you know I'm hey I'm on Twitter you know how about you send a you know a message then you tell me what kind of MRE you got and you know I'll send you like you know I'll tell you for you if I want that one and I I decided that we're we're just gonna do both sauces we'll do one barbecue when one honey mustard just to make sure we're giving it a fair shot here and for those of you with it with the sweet and sour sauce request you guys are like like the foot fetish of the chicken nugget sauce community and since we are you know doing two different sausages today I figured we do prepared two different styles one with our tried-and-true method here and the other one with the KitchenAid attachment sausage attachment so what we'll see which is the better method to sausage with so it's the it's the the Chicken McNugget sausage we'll try a different saucing method with this one [Music] I gotta say this look this looks like sausage breakfast sausage meat you know this only made a handful of sausage in it so you know you know I think we could just do this with one hand they made one sausage and you know it I think I have high hopes for this woman and I just realized that that this shape you know is probably more conducive to a better blow so let's give it a try here [Music] pretty much the same thing with it with this on it you know just a little bit lighter color but dig you know it's a texture you know the same so right now we're gonna put it in the bigger sausage stuffer money when you sitting there at the table where we're gonna go for distance on on this one you can clearly see you know which which system produced a bigger sausage clearly the the kitchen made one so so if you're gonna do small batches of sausages I recommend doing with it with a KitchenAid attachment because you there's just so much waste in the tube I guess we'll add go ahead and now you see which one tastes better this is a tragedy up until the final seconds it was it was looking just does the same thing with this one well you know we came so close we came so close to me when we just stumbled at the finish one and I didn't even buy sausage buns again I mean look at this misses sausage even went out and bought these nice props for the show display the final product and then we do this ah alrightlet's a little late diligent let's start with it let's start with the barbecue the barbecue wasn't bad it tastes like like pulled pork not not the greatest pulled pork in the world but it still tastes like pulled pork the breading is it's not it's not good it didn't blend well alright and now we'll move on to the honey mustard alright well this is this is actually a very easy decision the honey mustard is is the clear winner I don't know how much money you pay for it but it's a pretty decent sausage I I I'm gonna go ahead and give the honey mustard a three out of five and we'll say we'll give the barbecue a a two out of five right so a combined score of a two and a half out of five US sausages pop-pop-pop-pop "
