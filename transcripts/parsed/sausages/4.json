"okay folks we got a real good one here a California robe we got all the ingredients right here I think this is going to be the first time anyone's ever made a sushi sushi sausage we're gonna give it our best shot and see how it turns out okay we didn't do too bad over here it looks so pretty all right for a California roll you know it's just a lot of what we're ready to turn this into a sausage [Music] so texturally we it's very wet it's a sticky ball of mass is what is what this is it just doesn't look too appetizing I'll tell you how it tastes all right so that's it that's about four and a quarter sausages that's not too bad I think our parents hot enough let's go and get this to Charlotte hey let's start a little one in there not too shabby okay we'll get a nice medium-sized man and tragically the little one was the first to go the the big ones seem to be holding on a little bit better here so I'm a little nervous to try this but you know we're gonna give it a shot anyway here we go gave it a little wasabi you know it is sushi after all folks yeah I gotta say that this should not be attempted by anyone it's just not worth it it's it's a terrible food don't make your sushi into the sausages just leave it the way it is it's fine the way it is this this is getting a zero out of five with the warning - do not try at home pop pop "
