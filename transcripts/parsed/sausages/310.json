"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess i i had an epiphany the other day sausages that that had too much sauce or liquid in it tended to burst real bad i'm looking at you cactus sausage [Music] if we just mix in the dry ingredients then that should get rid of any any bursting opportunities because it it's a dry mix and we're gonna we're gonna make a vegetable recipe mix dip sausage with it and and see if that that solves the whole bursting thing so uh let's you know let's let's get to it we have our half frozen hefty thought uh pork here look at that just a clean cut every time okay it's like it's like low grade tuna no not on the floor it's okay it's okay a little floor has never hurt our sausages in the past just gonna add it right on in and not tell anyone else about it and because our meat's partially frozen already we don't we don't have to we don't have to throw it in the freezer for a few minutes it's mighty morphin mixture time there is our seasoning you know i i got a question how much is is too much we'll just go with the whole bag it smells like vegetable dip just a little bit just there we go that's plenty [Music] pretty well mixed i would say i know it's up for me if you steal my sausage i've switched sausage casing brands and this i gotta tell you this sausage casing already looks better than the other one oh look at that glide now this is sausage casing in three two one let's just search [Music] yeah now that's some good sausage casing i should have switched a long time ago my fault for being such a loyal casing customer well a lot of people are finding that the ruffalo box pretty upsetting at this point so so if you have any mark box hello art that we can blow pork at oh you would go ahead and send it my way on twitter anyway will it blow well that's a that's a pretty disappointing uh will it blow i feel pretty lightheaded after that one what one mark ruffalo what what else would this be here we go the smell of the vegetable dip is really really coming through now i feel confident in in calling this done cut that part off first of all all right let's open it up and see how we did well all right it looks it looks like a like a delicious vegetable medley but of course the the real test is is how does it how does that taste here we go it's actually very good i i wouldn't say it tastes like dip per se it it it tastes like like like dehydrated vegetables we probably didn't need to use the entire vegetable dip mix but you know it make it makes for a very flavorful sausage i like it a lot i think we've just reinvented the way that people can make sausages because why buy all these separate spices when you can just buy a a a dip mix or a soup mix oh shoop sausage that would be a good one not only am i impressed with the flavor but i'm impressed with my own ingenuity so i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 5 out of 5.
