"we're here folks and uh welcome back I guess these are the sausages that hurt the most whenever we sausage something that's more of a work of art than it is actual food you know that's a punch to the gut even for me it's got everything it's got strawberries it's got Bluer berries and the kiwi and uh peaches and pears and uh you know and then like this this this this this clear stuff it tastes like nectar but of course we know that this is gonna be very juicy of course we know if we use a pan it's gonna burst of course if we use a toaster oven it's gonna burst so at the end of the day the only option left is to smoke it we won't be using salt or Pepper or anything it's it's going to be flavored by the fruit tart itself you know we'll have a couple laughs we'll have a couple of uh well I guess that's it all right so you know enough yapping and more uh chucking this in the grinder this reminds me of my sixth birthday party when my dad sausage the fruit tart in front of me he said you're a man now all your fruit tarts are now gonna be in sausage form it's like I'm committing a war crime is it cruel that I made Mrs sausage look at this thing before I threw it in the grinder she was like oh is this for me and I said no it's for me [Applause] [Music] oh it's in my eye I thought I thought the crust of the of the fruit tart would would soak up more of this liquid because I am not a smart man isn't that right Mr Sausage yeah why why did you marry me dead ass dad Ash for all you sausage purists out there I mean we we got it we gotta thicken this thing up I would have loved for this to be a pure fruit tart sausage but when we cut it open I mean it was just gonna leak all over the place but also in the history of this show throwing cornstarch at the at the problem has literally never worked but I got a feeling that this time's the charm oh my God Mirage I'm telling y'all it's Josh it's Josh oh it's already coming out of the tube in terms of good signs that isn't what good God it's so heavy here that I'm used I'm using much casing oh it's almost at the finish line I will never know if there was fruit tart water or not in three two one let's Shawshank yeah oh God I hope that cornstarch Works will be in big trouble if it doesn't oh my God it's making so much sausage it looks like clown intestines you know it's such a high probability of bursting that I think I'm gonna lick these up just so that it if it bursts the whole thing doesn't burst it's it's segmented I'm gonna give it a poke there and a poke there oh heck and one more there we'll see if that does anything hopefully none of them burst but but hopefully the ones that we poke don't burst I mean this this is like it's my confidence is really low about this being successful Which special thanks to today's Smart Box hello box artist this guy I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow five Mark Ruffles well that well that's a little presumptuous don't you think this is a very accurate

oh no oh well oh my God what we've done here today will echo through eternity wow [Music] shots and uh you know what I think these are the ones that we poked holes in so should have done all of them I I think we were right to add the cornstarch because without it everything would have leaked out and uh we would have no sausages all right let's let's open this up and see how we did I mean we did bad but yikes ew all right here we go very nice here we go oh it's not bad it's actually pretty good you know the the texture is a mess of course I mean we know it was going to be gooey so that's neither here nor there um it tastes like blueberries and smoke you know let's let's do a little sausage autopsy here it's it's not quite solidified yet it's Smoky but it's sweet it's it's very desserty but it but it mostly tastes like blueberries it's a little bit better than the cat food sausage you know they they may look like they have mold on them but they taste really good the the texture of it is something you got to watch out for but um I'll I'll have to try to make this one again because there's something here so I'm gonna have to give this sausage here or you know what's left of it a three and a half out of five pop s "
