"it makes sense 63 hey there folks and welcome back I guess to a very special episode I'm not I'm not even mad about the water sausage anymore because you know we hit up we hit a new milestone we hit 100k and you know how to show that there's no hard feelings I'm gonna do the pickle sausage but but it but I will tell you one thing though I will be dead in the cold hard ground before I make a sausage out of sausage casing that's that that's you know that's the tastiest crunch you know that you know that there's ever you know that I've ever heard of it can be a new spoke person but these are you know the big boys here and I figured we would do pickles three ways we'll throw it in the grinder and make you know relish sausage and then we're gonna do an entire pickle just shove it right on in the casing see how that doesn't in and then we're gonna blend it in with some meat and see if we can actually make something edible out of this well well this is a bit of a gimme so I don't think there's throwing it in whole hog educate is gonna work for us [Music] well yeah you know I I remember though he's those hot summer days when my mom wouldn't she would make grinded pickles homemade boy do I miss those times I so classic you know that could that could be you know a spot right there so that's ordinary sausage that's ordinary sausage with a no but if you expected anything more than this then you know get yourself checked out cuz this is entirely what I expected just squeeze out the extra juice well obviously this is why I got into sausage in the first place start with you I think just the pickles and then we'll follow it up with the pickle combination that we made well unfortunately most of the pork sausage is still stuck in the tube so I'm gonna just try to jam my finger and look that looks like it's working pretty good I'll tell you this I bet they don't teach this at sausage in school this is this is the only kind of sausage in debt that you learn in the streets all right you know mrs. sausage is actually an expert at this method which sausage will be reign supreme will it be the one stuffed entirely in sausage casing depends too hot the pan is just way too hot or will it be the the the pork and pickled sausage or just the plain pickle sausage locking your votes now people well did you know that pickle juice and oil acts just the same way as water and oil in the hot pan starting from the left we have the pork and pickled sausage in the middle we have the entirely pickle sausage and on the right there we have the another sausage let's try the pork one first it's got a beautiful sear on it look at this and I bet you the Germans already have a sausage like this date they say oh we call that you know pickles Morken so let's give this one a shot I say this with all seriousness that this is a fantastic sausage you know it tastes exactly like you're biting into a hotdog with you know all the fixings on it you know there's no mustard in here or onions your brain just assumes that those other flavors are there and it really works the pork it's a little bit dry yeah so we did end up overcooking the poor I'm gonna give this sausage a 4 out of 5 that is it that is a surprising score for me I thought this was going to taste horrible well now now again and again with a beautiful sear let's go let's give that a shot well it burns like the dickens your absolutely no crunch from the skin that does just taste like molten pickle I'd say no that's not a good way to enjoy a pack this actually firmed up quite a bit this is just you know the relish a pickle it's not the worst sausage I've ever had on the show the casing itself is part so obviously that's not vegetarian but if we use a synthetic skin you know this wouldn't be too bad if we combined it with you know some chickpeas or you know something that just didn't have entirely pickle so this one I get this one I'd give it 1 out of 5 because we said that we were making a pickle sausage and not a pickle and pork sausage we're gonna go with you know the the high score of just the just the pickles here for this one we're going to give this a pickle sausage a 1 out of 5 pop pop pop yeah and then this is this is my life after the the sausage Inge it's it's not too glamorous but you know it is what it is hey there folks "
