"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess well taco bell's mexican pizza is back and i think i speak for everyone when i say thank god well that that one's looking a little better i wasn't sure how big these things were going to be so i got four of them just to make sure we got a good sausage uh you know a good good amount of sausage well there you have it it's back and it's here forever whether you like it or not come on come come come come to me there we go so you know it's got ground beef it's got things aren't looking so good already with this you know we got we're going to have a high water concentration with those tomatoes and of course we're gonna dump fire sauce on all this to give it that taco bell taste i can't believe the nation wanted this back if you're not racing to taco bell at this very moment then you know what's wrong with you and last but not least [Music] four mexican pizzas give you four cups of sausage filling so that's it that's pretty good each pizza is like five dollars and change so you know to have four cups of sausage for 20 bucks you know that's yeah that's i don't know is that good i will we'll see how many sausages it makes i have no idea what's love got to do with this got to do with it who needs a sausage when the sausage can be broken in three two one let's shush a little real life simulation on how how the digestive tract works because that ain't looking and looking so hot goodness gracious what what what have we done and we are gonna link these up to to ensure that we have at least one survivor out of this give her a twirl five sausages for twenty dollars you you you decide whether or not that's worth it or not to you with special thanks to today's mark boxillo box artist this guy i resent the notion that i that i oversalt my sausages i use a normal amount of salt there's the there's the buffalo this thing's already coming out the yin yang so will it blow a moderately successful will it blow i'd say so you know they mostly fell right there so i think we're gonna have to give this will it blow two mark all right these are going into the smoker for an hour we'll check on them after an hour and if they're still not done we'll get it then we'll do another hour almost in there they look they look pretty done to me i guess i will take them off now well they're they're still incredibly squishy let's open one of these up and and see if we need to go back on the smoker for another hour yeah i don't i don't know if any time on the smoker's gonna fix that all right let's give it a taste test before we before we make that final decision another hour's not gonna hurt anything i'm gonna throw it back on see see what happens oh yeah these are looking much smokier a little bit different in color here this one's a little bit lighter brown this one's a little bit darker brown if i squeeze it you can see that it's still plenty mushy so uh you know let's let's open this one up too and see how we did you can see the the tomatoes they're not dry they're they're still a little wet and there's really no difference between uh the inside of these wrap this hunker right there what a sausage what a what a big sausage that is okay here we go it's pretty good it tastes like it's stuffed with potato to be honest with you it tastes like um smoked potato it tastes like those potato bites that they used to sell do they still sell those that that extra hour on the smoker i don't it didn't it didn't it there's no solidness to this sausage here but not a bad tasting sausage that's the key it definitely tastes like taco bell in there there's no getting around that that extra hour didn't really help with the with the with the squishiness of the sausage but it did make it a lot smokier in flavor like double the amount of smoke since it went in for another hour i i'm pretty pretty unsure about whether or not to give this a three or a four but i i think i'll just split the difference right here and give it a three and a half out of five you "
