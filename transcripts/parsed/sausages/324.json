"well hey there folks and uh welcome to my apology video slash tequila sausage video what am i apologizing for well on tuesday i accidentally released two videos the aloe vera sausage and the tequila sausage at the same time what a so how does such an accident occur well the truth of the matter is i record these videos a week in advance that way in case if i get sick or injured or if an act of god calls me away from these videos at least there's a week to entertain you the fans some questions you may have is is it worse that this mistake was done on a sponsored video yes a lot worse question number two how did you confuse tuesday and friday with each other i and question number three are you naked underneath that sausage costume yes and it's starting to get hot and itchy but anyway i apologize for this mistake uh but without further ado for everyone else who hasn't seen it it's done it's the tequila sausage well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess now with with this sausage i figured that instead of pouring the alcohol directly in it we would uh grind the the the already made sausages in the tequila mixture so that it won't taste uh awful i think just dumping the alcohol right into the sausage meat uh does not make for a good sausage sausage prediction i think that this one's gonna be a four out of five okay let's do it [Music] all right we're going to season this with classic tequila seasoning salt not not not so much the pepper and limes well that's that's it that's a bit of a mess right there in the summertime you've got sauce that you got sausage on your mind all right in three two one let yourself [Music] gonna link these sausages up all right so we got three sausages out of that and then then we're gonna give that tequila some entry points into the into the sausage yep oh man why didn't i learn from the last time with that with special thanks to today's mark box hello box art this guy i was writing the fence about using this one because i wasn't sure if i wanted to give this thing physical form but anyway this will it blow is brought to you by misin do you like knives do you like to cut things with your knives does it help keep the voices away or does it make them angrier anyway knees and knives or more specifically mies and chef knives the most important tool for professional or home chefs alike or if you make sausages in your basement i love my new miso knife and not just for its looks this thing slices dices and chops without cramping my hand or my style and it keeps its head sharper for longer than those other more expensive knives you've seen you know on the internet in fact knees and knives are 2-3 times less expensive than other premium knife brands i use this knife for everything whether i'm cutting meat and vegetables for dinner or cutting up fruit because apparently no one else in my house knows how to do that and by the way these knives are guaranteed for life so feel free to get silly with it but don't take it from me listen to over 7 500 5 star reviews from satisfied customers go to the link in my description and use promo code sausage for 20 off your first order again go to the link in my

gonna have to give that while i blow like like like will you i'm gonna have to give that will it blow one mark ruffalo's all right this is this has been brining for about an hour and i you know it's it's turning well first of all the bag's leaking i i think we should try boiling these in tequila as well now unfortunately my induction cooker won't work on a pot with a bottom like this but if we use a little science what am i doing i have a whole bag of tequila for this that that seems like a dangerous amount of tequila helping the heat transfer here but of course i'm not a scientist i'm a sausages wow look at that tequila does boil you know like we've we today's episode we've we've learned so much wow it's really boiling all right this this has been boiling for like five minutes i'm gonna get these out of here stop spinning there we go and then we'll finish up with a classic sausage shear okay here we go all right i i think these little i think these guys are are pretty much done i think i've maybe made these things a little too small they're they're they're like half half the size that they probably needed to be oh wait we gotta chop one first oh let's open this up and see how we did wow it flew right off the board ah it looks like a sausage okay let's uh let's okay let's try it here we go ah it's good it's actually very light on the tequila flavor even though it was boiled and brined in it uh it has a light tequila aftertaste i i taste almost none of the lime that we put in i guess all that lime cooked out i get really the only problem is it doesn't taste enough like tequila you only get a little bit of tequila aftertaste i guess we probably could have put a little tequila in the meat mixture i i think i was spot on in the beginning with my prediction i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 4 out of 5. i don't i don't know what what exactly is fuming out of this thing but uh i'm gonna have to crack open a window down here "
