"well hey here folks and uh welcome back i guess now before we get started on on this this lovely idea here let me first say that you've got to be kidding me with the fog machine sausage it's poor it's literal poison i'll give you the synopsis of the ending negative one out of five because it killed me do not swallow not for human consumption an immediately contact physician or nearest poison control center it sits it stitch the candy apple and caramel apple uh sausage and not for nothing but you know those baby back ribs weren't on sale either so that like i was paying full price for those ribs twenty dollars for baby back ribs i could have cheaped out and gone with spare ribs how much do they cost their chilis they're like 14 bucks at chili's oh thank you mr sausage for going out of your way to making it yourself let us thank you by having you drink poison for our entertainment you better not embarrass me like in the candy corn episode [Music] there we go this is this is just like one of charlie's you know stupid healthy bowls yeah here you go this is that'll be 13. oh we we love you so much mr sausage now die for us drinking poison eating it no eating the poison mind you by the way i don't have a lot of faith in this sausage let's uh let's throw in some uh sugar cookies to kind of soak up some of this liquid cracked out whip when a problem comes along you must whip it and when your fans ask you to drink poison you must whip it all right in three two one let your sage now i'm gonna poke it but but just a few so hopefully you know that all doesn't leak out whoa that expanded quite a bit let's give it a couple more what what's uh what's uh what's going on what's going on with that one oh no well that's time to get that out of the pan even the grocery store knew that nobody was gonna be paying twenty dollars for baby back ribs that's why they were in the frozen section almost as much as the lobster tails and i'm not going to get into that all right let's look at this autopsy so one big burst we'll still be able to salvage this and and and just a little help from our friend uh sweet baby raise let's do this unsurprisingly it tastes amazing with the sweet baby raise but i mean you you could put that stuff on a tire and eat it i am not done with these barbecue people not by a long shot okay okay we we got to get a fresh sausage all right here's the here's the official one here we go the official bite i think we were on the right track with the sugar cookie it did solidify which which is a great a step in the right direction so we're moving our fruit sausages forward as as we tinker with the recipe even though it's mushy and the skins not uh as crisp as it could be i'm still gonna give this one a two out of five did you think i forgot about will it blow so you know will it i i'm i am in big trouble "
