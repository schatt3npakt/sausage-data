"hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess truth be told we we have done uh a big breakfast before we did the denny's grand slam and that only got a three out of five so we're gonna see if the mcdonald's breakfast can make it can make a better sausage it doesn't want to come out of the container give it a little happy face that looks like a happy face oh there's a sausage patty to go with it strawberry preserve make this muffin come alive there we go accordion eggs and then of course you just your maple syrup over the over the whole thing a hash brown well i don't know about you but i i'm certainly i'm certainly hungry all right [Applause] oh the sausage was hiding that looks pretty good i'm i'm predicting big things for this sausage i'm saying that this could go all the way to a four out of five i think i think it's got the the right stuff you can feel it it's a sausage boogie woogie woogie it smells like a thousand mcdonald's farts in here by the way if you didn't know we we do have an official sausage scorekeeping method called the sausagedatabase.com i see a lot of people making their own spreadsheets for sausage scores and stuff there's no need to make your own in three two one let shh [Music] there's a hole in it we gotta chop this log at least that guy needed i i switched casing brands and i should not have done that because ever since then these these sausages have been a nightmare to to get out of the tube all right let's see how much is left in here anyway could you could you do me the favor of sliding you gotta fight for it it should never be that difficult for the casing to slide not a chance that this thing blows but will it suck oh yeah that sucks so much i gotta give that five bet afflecks i'm just kidding i i actually i'm a big fan of ben affleck here we go hot hot hot they're looking pretty good they're looking pretty on target oh no they're starting to burn well like i think those are done all right let's open up one of these and and see how we did it looks dry and flavorless but we're gonna put that to the test don't sit there and tell me that doesn't look good here we go well it's it's delicious it's syrupy it's it's pancakey you get a little bit of the sausage uh the the mcdonald's sausage patty taste in there as well no eggs though can't can't taste the eggs and you can't taste the strawberry jam preserved either it's a little soft because of all the pancakes but it's not loose i think it beats the daddy's grand slam by one point i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a four a 4 out of 5. mcdonald's should really think about putting that on the menu because i cannot stop eating this thing here's your meal sir enjoy "
