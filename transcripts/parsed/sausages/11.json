"if you guys haven't noticed we have a new logo for the show one of the fans of the show he contacted me after the last one and said hey I'm a graphic designer and I think I think I can make a better logo and you know it said I just wanted to just just want to do it just to help out the show and so god bless him he didn't complain once through all of the revisions that I put him through and I and I know I put him through a lot so if you want to show your appreciation to this show to this channel you can do so by visiting at tech crates ones Twitter profile and let them know how much you enjoy the new logo alright and with that we'll start the show well hey there folks and welcome back I guess to another episode here and what an episode it is you may be saying hey but this these don't look like MREs there was a little screw-up at the post office and they're working on getting that package returned but until then we can celebrate the Jewish holiday here of Passover with some classic Passover foods we have the matzo gefilte fish some horseradish here you put that with the gefilte fish Manischewitz wine and we got some matzo ball soup mix so what we're gonna do a Passover sausage you know I think it said it's important that I try what these foods taste like when they're not in sausage form so we'll give that a shot no that's not very comforting all right there's a whole lot of shimmer I thought I was not expecting all right you know looks aren't everything it's a it's a hella taste you're supposed to eat the broth give it a little bit more of that and broth um there's you know maybe with the horseradish it's it that's where that you got a nice pizza matzah here it's a very cracker like give this a taste it's very dry without a whole lot of flavor do people just eat this you know look let's look look look look let's try the matzo ball soup you know what this would actually you with a little bit more salt I think it would be perfect okay remember the Vienna sausage episode oh my god it's mr. potato sausage oh let's give this Manischewitz a shot yeah okay I think our food tour is over and I you know I think it's sad time we make her some pass over sausages here [Music] the masa is curling up quite a party [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay we didn't do it too shabby now let's say I get it a stair and try to get some of that moisture out of there all right I just realized that that we didn't put the horseradish through the grinder but you know yeah it's it's fresh ground so give me a pass on this one this is warm it sticks to your fingers pretty good this is extra sticky it kind of looks like the matzo ball mixture is maybe this is what it's made out of okay we got eight sausages out of that and you don't want my you know I don't have high hopes for these sausages making it out of the pan alive so we're going to try our tried-and-true method here of keeping those sausages linked together and then you know using the ones that survived for tasting let's hope for the best here you know you you you never know unless you try oh that's just way too many I don't think they're all gonna fit in the pan but this is probably not the way you should go about it but that's that's how we're gonna do it today say we give it a little help which the Manischewitz looks like we have the first casualties over here there's time to swell pretty good here it's good filter fish you're starting to grow on me a little baby on second thought seeing how much those matzo balls ballooned up while boiling we should have known better well it's a massacre there's no other way to say this they all burst but we do have two that we're gonna try it's gonna be this one and it's gonna be that one okay I think that we should at least dress one of these with some of that gel broth from the gefilte fish well as you know they all burst but this one's definitely the most complete that still at least has the skin on so we'll give that one a taste it tastes almost exclusively like the matzo ball I can't taste any of the could felt the fish which you know it's kind of a good thing it's a little bit of the horseradish is not too much bite let's try the one that we jellied with the gefilte fish jelly jelly broth didn't really make a difference here it's not the worst sausage I've ever had on the show but it is very plain tasting it it tastes just like like a like a white bread with a little bit of eggy a little bit oniony it's just so plain that there's really no flavor behind it so one out of five but you know we do have Easter coming up so we'll see how we could destroy that holiday bop bop bop you know there's always a filter fish sausage let's try it out one that jelly broth that's what it's all about now now you get zero zero out of five "
