"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess the Fool's Gold loaf sandwich also known as the Elvis sandwich this is one of those rare sandwiches to reach legendary status you want to know how I made it take a pound of bacon or in this case just a little bit over a pound and fry it up in a pan then take a French bread Hollow it out butter it up stick it in the oven until golden brown then fill one side with grape jelly and the other side with peanut butter then add up your crispy fried bacon and then seal it shut yes you too can eat the same sandwich Elvis was eating when he died on the toilet and now it's time for a taste test mmm it is like the sum of its parts it's an upgraded peanut butter and jelly sandwich and I think it's worth making at least once but how is it as a sausage well all right a sandwich Fit For A King [Music] the peanut butter is a worthy adversary [Music] well we we managed to fill it up some parts look more jelly than they do peanut buttery so so we're going to have to mix this up with our old friend the vomit bucket looks like brains you better believe this one's getting thrown in the toaster oven Viva sausages you can't just do one Elvis song he's the king not only the king of rock and roll but also the king of darn while using the toilet you ain't nothing but a sausage crying all the time false cold water in three two one let's Shawshank return the sausage I think we have reached the end of the sausage rope indeed we have special thanks to today's Mark boxelo box artist this guy Mark Mark Fox hello or is that a cat one for the furries out there so will it blow we got we got a shot on the last third of it pretty dissatisfying overall so I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow one mark ruffalo's all right and we're gonna do low and slow again 265 for an hour all right we're about a third of the way done here and uh things are looking good so we'll keep going we're a little over halfway done and uh we got a burst right in the back with only 25 minutes left surely no more of it will perish although most of it has burst there is this little section right here that hasn't therefore we don't need to disqualify it I must have pissed off the ghost of Elvis with that toilet joke we'll just open it up right here and open it up right here child okay that's better sausage success oh no it's slowly ripping so we're gonna quickly do that here we go it tastes like a hot gritty peanut butter and jelly sandwich there's no trace of the bacon in there texturally it's you know it's it's on the crumbly side to really make this a good sausage I think it doesn't require even more cooked bacon I think it requires more raw bacon uh so so not a very impressive sausage uh by by any one standard so I'm gonna have to give this sausage here or what remains of it a two out of five pop injays [Music] "
