"well hey there folks and welcome back to another episode and hey we leave we finally got one we finally got the the MRE out of the four people that send me an MRE one made it why you know the post office yeah kind of dropping the ball you know these are these are uncertain times you'll have to make do with our mo reading extravaganza here with a menu item number seven this MRE was sent by @xp Crawford boys so go ahead and back you don't give him a thank you on Twitter for helping out to open at the show and providing such a tasty beef brisket well let's open it up in there to see we see what's in here we got a peelable seal I see it I see where it peels all right well over the bag what's that a thing was I just feeling that nothing well however you're supposed to open it I'm sure oh well this one is the actual brisket entree this is like the hot pocket sleeve toffee rolls some sort of candy Irish cream cappuccino instant powder our gratin potatoes and this is the self heating mechanism if they think these people thought of everything cranberries oz osmotic osmotic moist towelettes and whatever lighthouse is that toilet paper white wheat snack bread PFF really really unsure about what that is - I think we should at least try some of this stuff before we turn it into sausage so we know like you know what what's going on nice let's try these toffee rolls first these are just touchy rolls why don't they just call them tootsie rolls all right we snack bread it is it kind of looks like the lunchable bread it's got some it's got a little tear to it it's a it's not hard at all it's very soft you can push down on it a slightly sweet soft and cranberries Osmond osmotic house osmotic osmotic cranberries and they're right there just dry cranberry okay you know I think well it'd be safe to throw a couple of these in the sausage we also have some strawberry jam and some peanut butter I'm guessing it's that goes with the bread why would you tear it lengthwise and not the top way Jesus this is the most idiotic way to be opening up peanut butter definitely taste like um like a peanut butter that uh that you buy in the store again with the lengthwise why would you tear it this way why wouldn't you tear it that way I'm going against the recommendation I'm gonna tell I'm gonna tear it the way it should be torn oh look at that good Jim thermo pack LLC really know well what they're doing with the jams wow that's really good actually that's neither that's the best Irish cream cappuccino I've ever had now this selmak reference is that the primary Amory it doesn't say anything about you know a secondary are gratin potato mmm I'm gonna show up him try to shove both of them in there and if it doesn't turn out right now we'll know that they're you weren't supposed to shove to a moment two of them in there alright we got one in there let's see if we could we could cram this other one in there space is tight again not sure if you're supposed to throw both of them in there but I want I want my out rotten potatoes to be hot we're gonna we're gonna give it up we're gonna give her shots you see if we can do this right now we're just gonna play the waiting game all right let's see how we did little hot to the touch see this and you know I figured out that you know you could just you know cook them one at a time you don't have to cook above what is what the side opening people let's see let's open it from the top why are we opening it lengthwise well the smell is tremendous oh that's just that's it that's a that's a beauty right there test try it tastes like if someone made a stew out of Jack Link's beef jerky that's exactly what that tastes like that big smoke that they have is really just they went overboard with it I think try a big piece of our gratin that's a little bit more pleasant this kind of tastes like potatoes with it with the kind of cheese that they sell at the gas station [Music] that's how much there was so what we're gonna be using the little grinder the consistency it's so good like can't throw up well we sinned against God we're gonna try to poke hole experiment again some people say I gave up too easy so this one will poke holes in this one we won't pocos it oh oh oh these look like way moans if you've ever had that before oh you oh they both burst there's no winners all right now that we got a boil look it will give it a nice sear I'm pretty cook still jiggly we still got some juggle going on this is a tragic tale because this actually tastes pretty good it tastes like sloppy joe I think adding those cranberries into it it got rid of a lot of that that fake smoky flavor and it was a real big improvement if their sausage what I made it this would have been a four out of five but for a sausage I'm afraid we were disqualified pop-pop-pop-pop you betrayed me for the last time "
