"hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess and right off the bat let let me just say that there will be no will it blow in this episode so we're going to be doing a blood sausage shed that you know so that's really what we're gonna we're just chilling and and also we we had that we had to order it from the uk in in order to and they had to fill out like a form and everything in order to get it in do not use this video as some sort of tutorial to teach you how to make blood sausages because that that i have no idea what's happening here this is the pig's blood it's it's dry pig's blood it it kind of just looks like sand i feel like putting some of this in my backyard and letting my kids play around with it so it's actually a very simple recipe well you need your pig's blood fat back steel cut oatmeal onion and an assortment of seasoning that was the dumbest thing i've ever done well that's a whole lot frothier than i ever could have imagined this is uh amazing and uh and sure and said i guess now is the time we pack it all in this has been a bloody mess this is this is i've been a pain in the stuff this is my least favorite episode of all time it's just it's there's just so much blood here which i think had like the most innards as we go along the more blood is in the filling so we'll try one from each end of the spectrum and we'll save the rest for the the uh the complete english breakfast sausage well all right let's let's put our two uh our two test dummies in there this one seems more stuffed this one seems to have more blood and now the one that that had more blood in it than it had stuffing we'll give that a shot it's it's a strange flavor i i don't know how to describe it it's peppery i don't even know if it's supposed to taste like this or not for all i know this could be a complete screw-up now that we've tried it that way let's get let's get this in the bun this is absolutely stunning let's ignore the fact that this looks like two turns on a hot dog bun and and and and go ahead and eat this i prefer it more uh on the bun than i than i do uh just plain i'm gonna have to get a hold of some actual blood sausage and see how i did in comparison i'm gonna give this uh uh uh a 3 out of 5.
