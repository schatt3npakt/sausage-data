"well hey there folks and welcome back i guess and i'm here too okay first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna open the sausages the little smokies i think you think you need a knife i'm just gonna dump them out oh there's juice okay we're good next we open i don't know what to do i thought you said that's why we were doing these because this is the one thing you knew how to cook i mean i just know it's easy well that's why i'm here because we're here to i can open a can i mean i've done it before i think see there we are i don't have a lot of space you just got the juice everywhere like it wasn't dripping i didn't know you had a pan ready for me i didn't we don't cook them in a pan roll it around i've gotten the juice well you didn't have everything i needed you weren't prepared the squishy you're making it difficult you're overwhelming me i'm cooking these conditions you're overwhelming me there uh cut that into a manageable i'm gonna use my fingers you've got your little strip so you can wrap your little little smokies in it would just be cleaner if you just well you gave me a butter knife can i have the sausages i put them conveniently located in this pan if you weren't standing over me i wouldn't have certain problems now we're not supposed to put them where am i supposed to play them when they're when they're wrapped yeah see i think i'm afraid of missus put them on put them on the pan what's all this i don't know is that good that'll that'll be plenty to make sausage with all right mrs sausage this goes into the oven for how long you you threw away the can i don't know we're gonna play it by ship here we go oh did you see you see what happens why don't we take a sample bite it's going to be like 10 minutes before i can put one of these babies in my mouth may i offer you some mustard you don't put mustard on them we don't need mustard no no no no no they're good on their own oh yeah mind if i try wait we need them for sausages [Music] okay here we go we're wasting them better be worth it really what we've accomplished is just making hot dogs did we have to wrap them yeah so we just made biscuits and like no i wish you would step back from that sausage my friend i think i already did that one does it matter i haven't done it yeah well now see the board's here it's slid well good we'll get some more hot dog juice on it so i gotta like find an opening if those hands could talk all right wait where does it make it any less okay what's oh my god okay okay okay in three two one let's sausage oh god i'm gonna hug it i'm too short this reminds me of high school it's supposed to be that thick it's no thicker than any other sausage you're gonna do this part right will it blow that was pathetic there it is zero microflows and you guys thought i was hard judging those shot those will it blows and so now the next thing you do is poke it with the sausage stick it's not done i thought we have to cook it too we're not eating it raw it's not raw it's been cooked it's the bread not the casing is that good is that enough i mean i never measure is that enough oil maybe okay here we go can i use a fork what if you poke the sausage in it first i've already poked the sausage do i need to use my fingers you don't care if i burn my hands i mean these are really the hands that matter that kind of looks like a backward seat oh we got a burst you sabotaged me we got a pretty significant uh burst there i think it's done take it out take it out take it out it's okay yeah oh not far enough i think this has as much possibility of getting a five out of five as the fried bologna sausage let's see how we did oh where's the mustard uh-huh now i told you it should have had the mushrooms where's the mustard what more instant that's a 5 out of 5 sausage i'll be the judge of that i agree with your assessment i think that this is another five out of five sausage had we included the mustard inside of the sausage we wouldn't have sausage is meant to have toppings we're gonna have to give this sausage a five out of five i follow the instructions the instructions say to put the water in the pot "
