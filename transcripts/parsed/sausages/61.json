"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess to another episode and uh no that we're not cleaning out our cabinet today we're making we're making uh meatloaf we're gonna be doing this two ways normally on the show we we would just make the meatloaf and you know and then turn that into sausage we're still gonna do that but we're also going to try the ingredients raw inside of the sausage well all right so it's it's the meatloaf two-way sausage [Applause] first we gotta mix the ingredients ground beef pork one cup dried bread crumbs half a cup of diced yellow onion half a cup of milk one beaten egg a tablespoon of warp stitcher shire tablespoon of parsley flakes 3 4 tablespoon salt tablespoon of garlic powder black pepper then of course when you realize stirring with your favorite stirring device doesn't work first you you take off you take off you know the the ring and then and then you then you just go in let the rhythm take you over by the [Music] mouse there's our there's our one meatloaf sausage we're no strangers to love you know the rules and so do i wait ketchup was supposed to go into this we we got to mix it in we're going to call that two teaspoons some some people say that it's it's the ketchup that's the best part of the uh experience of eating the meatloaf half a cup of ketchup two tablespoons of brown sugar and one tablespoon of red wine vinegar this this is your world you can you can paint it however you want let's move [Music] all right there's our loaf of meat and uh between you and me i i i don't think it could look uh any more loaf here that's a classic your mom's meatloaf right there all right yeah i i say it's time we sausage this bad boy [Music] [Applause] you know this really doesn't look uh uh much different than when it went in chew down never gonna run around and hurt you i i feel like this is entirely way too much [Music] in three two one let's sausage oh that wasn't too bad this is my city i decide who gets to sausage around these parts it's like the big spoon in the little spoon really it's a love story a sausage love story come to my sausage but the the way i picked this up was not very sausage-like and it did it burst the plus side is you you got plenty of room for error this one is a little bit mushier than uh this one this one doesn't it's a little bit firmer all right uh we'll we'll start with uh uh the uh this one i think now's a good time to be using ketchup now we'll give this one a try as well we'll try the end that says so we'll get a good crunch not so much a good crunch and as you can see it continues to just split apart the clear winner is this one i mean i it's it's the most like a sausage the bread crumbs do make it a little bit more soft than a normal sausage this one lost all of its flavor this is like eating uh the bread has more flavor than any of the meat inside of here it sucks this one however is great i don't think it's surprisingly good i mean it's got everything you need for a delicious sausage this one is getting as a zero but this one however is getting a four out of five [Music] buh "
