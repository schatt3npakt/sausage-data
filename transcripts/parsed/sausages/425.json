"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess Yoshi specifically fresh rolled tuna with you know avocado and some sort of uh orange sauce on it I know what you're thinking haven't you done a sushi sausage before yes they're too mushy to be a five out of five but this time if we dehydrate it and extract the flavor then we'll be able to make a pretty good sausage I think so that's what we're gonna do we're gonna dehydrate this Sushi we're gonna blend it all up and then we're gonna add it to Pork so you know strap in and strap on and well no no don't do that we'll just kind of lay them all out there look at that we got some tuna we got some avocado there it's uh you know all right so we'll see you in 24 to 48 hours and that's 24 hours it's dry but it's got a ton of oil on it you know it's not it's not the most appetizing looking thing in the in the world this is the ginger and wasabi by the way it smells like it did you know before we dehydrated them but before we turn this into a powder let's give it a taste test foreign in all honesty it's really not that bad it it tastes like spicy crackers I I will give it this the smell has intensified quite a bit not bad all right well then we'll finish up with those three and then and then we'll we'll get to the sausage making and this is the last time I used this grinder for coffee making purposes okay we have our spice and we got our pork give it a couple whacks that's about a pound and a half of pork pie [Music] Moment of Truth well I hope we got these ratios right well they it it appears to be evenly coated I do want to do wanna close my eyes I do wanna fight cause I still miss you baby and I do want a sausage things good okay if this is successful do you know how many sausages need to be redone this way there's like 300 and something episodes two one let's Shawshank well that was a very enjoyable sausage experience with special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy oh he took he stole my joke I mean uh yeah in all honestly that that doesn't look like a thing like Mark Ruffalo that's a pretty good Mr Sausage though this will it Blow is brought to you by Manta sleep Manta sleep the makers of the world's best sleep mask sure you could pound energy drinks and coffee suppositories until the cows come home but nothing beats a good night's sleep or an afternoon nap for that matter that's why Manta sleep is about rejecting hustle culture and giving naps a PR makeover with their Pro nap movement instead of finding that urge to nod off a bit listen to your body and take a little nappy poo when you're feeling tired but if you can't catch those ease because of that pesky sunlight don't you worry about a thing because Manta sleep is gonna block out the Sun and not with nuclear winter but with their comfortable form-fitting sleep mask I use the Manta sleep mask Pro it blocks out 100 of the light with its C cup shape and advanced perforated materials it's designed for maximum airflow and Comfort they've got Mass design for every kind of sleeper weighted masks silk masks cooling masks steaming masks and masks with Bluetooth so you can listen to lullabies while you drift off to sleep land check out man to sleep by clicking the link in the description box below and make sure to use code sausage for 10 off your order show will it blow oh you've got oh [Music] Shucks didn't even hit the box I'm gonna have to give that while I blow half a Ruffalo oh here we go well all right I think I think we're pretty much in the clear for done this year well it looks pretty good what do you what do you say we uh open it up and see how we did what a big boy you are okay here we go uh it tastes like tuna it's disappointing uh it was a little bit of salt and pepper in there I think just going in with just with just the powdered Sushi was a a mistake it's it's not bad it's it's certainly not great either also the texture is a little bit weird it like form these little these little balls it's it's not it's not completely solid well let that be a lesson to you you got you gotta still put salt and pepper in your sausages no matter what the ingredient might be there's no Umami in this I was expecting huge things big things so I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a three out of five pop "
