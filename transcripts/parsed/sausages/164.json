"well hey there folks and welcome back i guess we're go wait we got we got six varieties here of the of the johnsonville this firecracker one i think this one's made from the meat that falls on the ground that's the special flavor the first thing that we should do is probably give each one of these a taste test and rank them and then we'll sausage them into one sausage and see if that's better than the best tasting a sausage so it's the johnsonville get some water boiling i i hope i'm going to be able to just figure out which is which except this one i'm pretty sure i'm going to immediately know what this one when i eat that one all right we got sweet italian sausage hot italian sausage original broth uh uh beer battered broth tailgater brats and this abomination it's an acquired taste this one that's a two out of five i'll give that a three out of five i'll give that a four out of five i'll give that a two out of five that's that's a four out of five sausage right there that's like that's like a four out of five as well we'll say that the score to beat here is a three and a half out of five [Music] with your powers combined i'm one sausage oh you better believe this is getting a regrind captain sausage he's a hero gonna take sausages down to zero i think i could use another one captain shaw he's a hero one more time captain sausage look at him go oh i i just sausaged in your arms tonight all right in three two one let's charge you know six sausages went in and and we got four and a quarter out so you know that's you know that's pretty bad all right let's get that raw pork right up on my lips will it blow it does not blow [Music] these guys i'm gonna save hoping to have a little backyard barbecue now the time has come to get right back to where we were so here we go we've come to the time where we uh you know see how we did uh yeah i mean it's a sausage and and i guess it's it's also time to try the sausage officially but first we got some fan art that we gotta there we gotta open well we're we're we're back where there's no room at the actual table so we're gonna just put it right there for everyone's enjoyment enough people have complained in the comments that they that they want the tasting table back so this is from uh brittany and john hold on is this they they they sent me some some poop earrings what is this oh then this isn't poop these are this isn't poop at all i'm sorry brittany and john these little faces here on on the on the on these keychains here uh however if you turn them around they just look like little little little duties thank you uh brittany and john now we're gonna you know we're gonna do that what we're here to do i i think we cracked the code that johnsonville doesn't want you to know this is a five out of five sausage usually with johnsonville their sausages are good but they're good for you know the masses the flavors kind of toned down on johnsonville uh sausages but when you combine them all into one sausage your taste buds don't know what to focus on and it's like a flavor delight i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a five out of five i could have walked away i i i could have walked away "
