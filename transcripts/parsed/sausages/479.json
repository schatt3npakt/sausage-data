"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess at first I didn't even realize these were granola bars it says almost everything but granola except right there and fine print right there well okay we got a variety pack of chewy granola bars here and um I think that they're going to turn into a real good sausage we're not going to mix it with meat we're going to we're going to try to get the true essence of the chewy chocolate or I mean granola bars and there it is you know life is all about finding the right balance and nothing will make you more unbalanced than eating an entire box of these but you know it was it was College I was experimenting nothing will make you race faster to the toilet and keep you there for a long time then eating an entire box of these they all look the same they are a little bit sticky so I'm kind of I'm kind of worried that these might Jam the grinder you've got to be kidding me see if we can lube it up a little there we there it there it goes you can't out Fox the sausage man oh my god what have we done it disintegrated it's all concentrated right in the top here I we may have made a whoopsy here now what we've actually managed to accomplish here uh is we made we made a sludge why can I never get an episode that runs smoothly every episode feels like I'm just battling things going wrong oh it looks like college all over again all right chunky but funky loving a sausage Vater living it up while I'm going down whoa I'm missing the bucket W and three two one let [Music] shage well that's it good God wa special thanks to today's Mark box Alo box artist this guy why am I so thick so will it Blow lots of spray lots of uh Mayhem I'm going to have to give that will it Blow four [Music] Ruff okay here we go wow how did this burst let's open it up and see how we did it's a it's a little on the goopy side here we go it's pretty good taste wise it's it's a five out of five you know the granola tried its best to soak up some of that water um and for the most part it it did a pretty good job I'm thinking it's gooey not because of the water but because of the chocolate chips and the the amount of sugar in there the skin could be crispier the sausage could be more solidified but other than that it's a punch in the mouth of of deliciousness so I'm going to have to give this sausage here a three out of five I'm going to make make it thin make it real thin make it make it difficult for this to burst "
