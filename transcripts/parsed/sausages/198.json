"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess all right so this recipe calls for uh just just a whole lot of cheese i mean we got we got we got we got ounces of the stuff here lobster mac and cheeses is essentially a way for restaurants to charge you fifteen dollars for two dollars worth of ingredients and quite frankly i would say that i've never had a lobster mac and cheese that was worth it that is until today jesus christ rifle so it's the lobster macaroni and cheese sausage first we need to boil the lobster tails but the water isn't boiled yet so which will work so we're going to make the sauce first add a hunk of butter to a different pot flour it up until it's like a paste dump in just a ton of milk and stir it aggressively then start adding what appears to be just the wrong amount of cheese how is it possible that this is the right amount hey look at that did that that was actually the right amount all right add some pepper and just a sprinkle of that's way too much nutmeg well it's it's too late to go back now drop in the lobster tails and cook them until cooked now cook the macaroni in the lobster water get the lobsters out of the shells the best way you can then chop it up into bite-sized pieces put the cooked macaroni in an oven safe vessel followed by the cheese sauce followed by stirring the macaroni in the cheese sauce followed by adding the lobster in followed by more stirring finally we make the toppler i'm already in two parts deep so i'm not breaking out a pan for this but you you probably should do that anyway get that pot all nice and buttery and add the panko bread crumbs and then top your lobster mac and cheese throw it in the oven for like 30 minutes and and then you know get you know give that bad boy a shot it certainly tastes like macaroni and cheese with lobster in it but what what do you say we throw this in the grinder and make sausage out of it for all time sake i wanna sausage all over and over again to the night closure to the night closures all right in three two one let's just that's that's one ugly looking sausage will it blow two thirds of it ended up on the floor and that's what we're left with i'm gonna have to give this will it blow one mark ruffalo's here we go all right let's let's open her up and see how we dig well it it it it it it it it pri it primarily looks like our macaroni and cheese and now we're gonna it's time to taste the sausage but first a little a little fan uh a male opening has never heard a single soul thank you a virtual ghost this is this is a fantastic interpretation of a sausage all right enough messing around let's try this sausage it it it 100 tastes like macaroni and cheese i taste zero of the of the lobster in this lobster mac and cheese sausage i i wouldn't go through all the trouble of of making this to to make it into a sausage and for that reason alone i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a two out of five buh [Music] "
