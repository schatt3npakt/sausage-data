"well he did folks welcome back I guess to another episode and before we get to the episode first some sausage news that I've been up in employed so uh first up in sausage news we are good on Emory so not only do we have these but we also have a few that are still in the p o-- box so oh man this is all crooked now and a second hey you know is to two things certain in life one is that jontron had the better I'm not so grump in the game grumps and two is hey we all make mistakes and in the last video for the score art I accidentally credited the wrong person for the person who worked so hard on the art you know he didn't get the credit that he deserves so we are going to fix that mistake right now for this score art that was featured in the last one please visit DB film underscore Ontario so go on Twitter and say hey you know well you know thanks for you know and the third thing is you know I thought just putting stuff in the description people would read it but apparently a lot of people don't go into the description of the YouTube videos so yes to answer a very common question yes I I do finally have a patreon and you can find the link in the description or I can just tell you right now that it's patreon.com slash ordinary sausage so you know not too hard to figure out enough about the news I I know that we want it we want to get to the sausage and my local Chinese restaurant has finally opened back up so well with that I think we should just go right ahead and get to the sausages [Music] it did it made about a medium-sized snatch a sausage if I didn't tell you what this was you'd say hey what is this that the Thanksgiving episode joke again I think I have a new technique that I that I thought of while I was on the toilet and you know I think I'm worried we have the answer to our sausage bursting problem and it's a spacing issue and we're going to solve that with the the with the right now okay so I think that right the issue is spacing right we've been packing into sausage and sealing them we're not really doing ourselves any services by by doing that so I figured that we just leave a lot of space in between links and keep them open that way you know if anything starts expanding it will just spill out of you know the end so that's right that's my sausage theory you know I didn't I didn't go you know to sausage you know University like like my father you know that's a topic all of it so let's give this theory a shot okay here we go there is method to this madness and I will show you you know why this doesn't look like you know you know part of you you know this looks like oh man maybe that's only you know for one sausage alright it's better to risk it on two small ones than than than one normal-sized one so these aren't lookers but you know what we're just trying to get a sausage that you know won't burst on us here we go it's almost alien in nature well I'll tell you what folks you know these sausages they couldn't they couldn't be you know how the part they just had to come together it's a it's a real you know love story in the form of sausages Mazel Tov despite all things has turned out to be you know a pretty normal looking sausage even though we started off with you know two and it merged into one it's got a good crust on it it's not jiggly the hopes are high for this one I'm gonna eat it I'm gonna tell you how it is alright so I think first we'll take a bite and then we'll start to add in our condiments and seeing if that affects the overall score so well here we go first initial bite well the first initial bite it's it's pretty plain Jane I mean it does taste like an egg roll but because we don't have that egg roll wrapper across we don't worry we don't have that kind of crunch we do have a little bit of crunch from the skin here let's see if we can dress it up with you know some condiments because you know I you know I eat my egg rolls you know with the duck sauce in the hot mustard go overall feelings you know you know putting the duck sauce and mustard on it boosted the score for me so have we not have had any condiments this would be a 2 out of 5 but with adding the hot mustard in duck sauce it's going to elevate that to a 3 out of 5 pop pop pop you know truth be told I've been eating the heck out of the sausage stuff and you know since the start of this thing because boy do I love myself some egg rolls in it which it's just you know ashamed what we do for the love of sausage "
