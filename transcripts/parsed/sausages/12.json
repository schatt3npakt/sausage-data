"hey folks welcome back to a special episode of the sausage show we got the marshmallow peeps here although these are these are looking more like bunnies you can't have Easter without jelly beans of course and then and then we got some some dyed eggs so we're doing Easter surprise saucy aged [Music] this actually makes a pretty good egg salad [Music] Cardon this isn't going to how I planned all right this thing's gummed up pretty good let's take a look what's going on in there [Music] [Applause] [Music] well I'm not gonna lie folks this this looks plain awful come and really hang out real quick happy Easter everybody these do actually look like Easter sausages all right let's get them in the pan watch them burst and get on with our day everyone all right well that that one must have come as a shock to nobody oh there goes the second one on paper we get everything right well it's an Easter miracle at any of these survived out of the pan and we got three of them I thought this would be you know as big of a failure as our Passover special and there it is yeah I think the only thing next up to do is there the taste test her writings oh here we go it's surprisingly gritty I think it's because of all the sugar that they use on the outside of the peeps I think that got blended in with every well of course it got blended in it with everything this taste very heavily of the but the jelly beans and you can see why the jelly beans just basically turned into syrup it's definitely not worse than the Passover sausage but it's certainly not any better I think we could have just left it with eggs and that would have that would probably turned out to be a pretty good sausage anyway the Easter surprise sausage one out of five bop bop-bop-bop "
