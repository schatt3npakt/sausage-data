"hey folks how you doing listen got a special treat for you today you got these big next year maybe it'll be a good treat to turn them into sausages you know McDonald's make such a wonderful product you got three different buns here you got the top you got your patty look at you get the special pickles there you got three of them it's some onions and boom just when you thought it was done another layer you got another patty and another layer of cheese that's beautiful so let's cut these up and turn them into some sausages got a little pickle spillage but that's okay it's all gonna be going into the into the grinder there that looks pretty good looks pretty good I think we could we could probably stop right there and see we'll see what it does in the grinder and today I'm gonna be using an electronic grinder I figured it'd be a whole lot faster if we just used a electric one we'll take some of the dough meat there and we'll just shove it right on in you always want to make good you want to have a nut you don't want to you don't want this thing to run dry all right let's get it started okay we appear to give the image go in there looking pretty good a lot of you might be saying hey don't shove your hand down there and that's good advice we're just going to shove it right on in [Music] [Music] that looks pretty good that looks pretty good to me right there that's got a consistency of a ground beef there you know a little bit dry uh perhaps then you might be used to for ground beef try to get it in there all in one go how do you might be saying hey what about the casing that goes around it he can't just you can't just make a log at a food and call it a sausage in it and I would agree with that I would agree with that so today we're gonna be using some natural hog casing yeah that looks pretty good we're just gonna do a plan B here just gonna give this a couple of cranks and then let this sausage start coming out and we're gonna call that one that's a good-looking sausage right there I'm gonna take that and twist it one more sausage gentleness oh that's beautiful oh yeah ain't never seen sausage like this from look and how that just comes out perfectly all right let's see if we could get one more of this oh I think I think that's all she wrote folks I think down I think we did pretty good here pretty good okay then I guess the last step is to finally cook these bad boys so gonna get this pan nice and hot just a splash of olive oil here just add just a tiny bit okay I think we're good to go here let's say let's go ahead and give it a shot all right so far so good there okay looks like 12 of them survived pretty good we got a problem over here this one done used to have burst we're not gonna okay so it looks like we got the tuna came out pretty good and then this one this one just ripped it this one's no good we're not gonna eat this split right right in half - that's not good sausage but these two look pretty good so I decided address one of them up with some mustard there you know the sauce should all be already in there but you know we'll see we'll see the difference between the two you pop-pop-pop-pop "
