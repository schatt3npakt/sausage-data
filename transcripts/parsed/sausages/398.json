"look how greasy the bag is you all said I had to go to Gene and Jude's for the best hot dog in the world so if I make a sausage out of that hot dog then technically I would have made the best sausage in the world and when you boil it all down they really have three things on the menu hot dogs french fries and and tamales but they sell their hot dogs in two varieties the single and the double also they don't allow you to eat there that's why I'm eating it down here and their hot dogs come with the french fries already on it it's not like they they shove the french fries in the bag too this one must be the single dog with just as much French fries on it if not more than the double dog so besides the french fries it also is a classic Chicago dog minus the poppy seed bun it's got Sports Peppers which you know I love onions mustard and of course the uh the hot dog um Mama how are you even supposed to be eaten you know when you combine all the ingredients together including the french fries it's it is a very tasty hot dog but you know it's still very much is a hot dog they're America's best restaurant for putting stuff on top of a hot dog but definitely the best hot dog we've had to date on the show I'm gonna give that hot dog a four out of five really the star of the show are these french fries you should go there for the french fries all right we're gonna we're gonna sausage this thing in its entirety foreign [Music] [Music] here we go unfortunately it diminishes the quality quite quite a bit it mostly tastes like reheated potatoes so we failed today in in making the world's greatest sausage out of the world's greatest hot dog it just tastes like reheated potatoes and and and we lost that hot dog magic so I'm gonna have to give my sausage a two out of five but Gene and Jude's world's greatest hot dog again I'm gonna have to give that a four out of five "
