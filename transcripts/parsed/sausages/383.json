"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess we'll mark your calendars remember where you were this day when you found out which french fry makes the best sausage my personal favorite of course is the McDonald's french fries you you can never go wrong with McDonald's french fries in case anyone was wondering Arby's is my second favorite all right so we got five french fries to sausage here [Music] thank you since they're all french fries it's gonna be hard to tell which one's which so we're gonna we're gonna dye them a little bit with some food coloring starting with BK red Wendy's blue Chick-fil-A green for some reason Arby's orange uh you know probably the Arby's probably didn't need this the armies looked food colored enough the Arby's looks no different and McDonald's yellow Puff the Magic sausage lived by the sea uh show you know what it it's compressed in the tube it's not coming out we're gonna have to hand stuff these ah that was never gonna come out Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy so will it blow it does not blow sorry Mark Ruffalo box I'm gonna have to give that will it blow a zero Mark Ruffalo it's a rainbow of sharks I even combined them all into one sausage to see if that one might win and to ensure that they all cook up evenly we're gonna throw them all in the toaster oven all right and we'll do 325 for 30 minutes we're a little over halfway and uh these are cooking up nicely yeah yeah I say we let it go for another half an hour well they don't look too much different but they are a whole lot crispier than they were well all right let's open them up and see how we did it's not mashed potatoey at all these are these are all cooked pretty well they all look and feel the same well I mean besides the food coloring I don't I don't have enough buns so I had to cut them in half all right well we'll we'll start with the McDonald's and and and work our way down here so uh here we go this one's the Arby's here we have Burger King Wendy's Chick-fil-A and finally all the flavors can bind together I've arranged these in order from least to best these two are a zero out of five the McDonald's and all the sausages combined are completely flavorless so that's a zero this one's Burger King this one's Chick-fil-A these two are getting a one out of five Wendy's blue is getting a two out of five and the Arby sausage is the best one the most flavorful that's getting a three out of five so Arby's wins this contest we'll give the final score as the best tasting sausage which is the Arby's curly fries I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a three out of five pop up it's not about what I like it's about what the what what the whatever "
