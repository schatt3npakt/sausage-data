"well hey there folks and welcome back to this moderately special edition of ordinary sausage why is it special because my microphone only started working halfway through the episode and I didn't find out until I went to edit it just now s La V anyway astronaut ice cream or freeze dried ice cream if you've ever had it I bet it was the first and only time I it's it's essentially flavored chalk but if you ask me it tastes like that time when your dad missed your violin re title I mean you you need a PhD just to understand the ingredients I'm getting constipated just looking at it ping boom bow usually sugary things jam up the grinder so I decided to mix the pork in with the astronaut ice cream okay the audio is about to turn back on here we go that looks like pork that's gone bad we're going to polish this turd up with a little bit of salt and the dusting of pepper by the way I am concerned about the developing cult of personality around the Doritos dinosaur in the ordinary sausage Reddit I'm in recovery we're all very proud of you Doritos dinosaur I'm just kidding I love Doritos give me those Doritos take it one day at a time Dorito's dinosaur well you see it on TV or read it in a magazine celebrities that want sausages that's the astronaut ice cream water in three two one let sausage if using the perfect amount of casing Is Wrong I Don't Want to Be Right wait special thanks to today's Mark box Alo box artist this guy what the so will it Blow we got one little tiny Speck right above Mark ruffalo's glistening pecs so I'm going to have to give that will it Blow one Mark Ruff okay here we go all right this goose is cooked Let's Get It On The Cutting Board well all right let's open it up and see how we did oh my God it's still raw all right I got a I'm going to microwave this real quick microwaving it was not the correct solution here it's split wide open doing that little sausage magic trick everything's fine again okay here we go it's actually very good it it basically tastes like a big breakfast sausage so not so nothing really too crazy I mean it's got the sweetness from the astronaut ice cream uh but unlike other sugary sausages the the sugar didn't melt and turn into syrup or car so it's so it's a pretty good sausage there's really nothing wrong with it I mean there's nothing spectacular about it either if you gave someone this and told them it was astronaut ice cream they would say it tastes like a slightly sweet sausage uh I would say it tastes a little bit more chocy than it does vanilla e or strawberry it's fine it's a fine sausage so I'm going to have to give this sausage here a four out of five I bet they wish they all could be California Girls "
