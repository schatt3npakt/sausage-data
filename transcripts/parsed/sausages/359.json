"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess we got our Michael Simon pierogies and uh there they are we got 24 pierogies the cost 100 and because Michael Simon is from Cleveland I decided what a great opportunity to have someone else from Cleveland to judge these pork and sauerkraut pierogies my mom hey everybody how you doing Joe are you ready to judge some some pierogies absolutely and exactly when was the last time you were in Cleveland 30 35 years ago can't stay away long enough what a god-awful place anyway we're not here to judge Cleveland we're here to judge these pierogies well now we're dealing with 23 pierogies they're a lot smaller than I thought they would be Michael Simon I mean who knew he was so cheap and there's only three steps so I think what we're gonna have to do is go back upstairs and boil these what do you think of that I think it's a terrific idea okay okay oh my God and wow these pierogies are starting to split open I'm starting to see why he's called former Iron Chef Michael Simon well all right that's that's five minutes on these zombies pierogies option two is to serve with butter and onion and horseradish sour cream on the side which is only available as an add-on and does not come with the 100 order if you had to guess how much half an onion costs and quarter of a cup of sour cream how much does that go for these days 35 cents and Michael Simon's trying to get every bit of it out of me okay looks like it's stuffed with tuna fish what do you think it tastes like tuna fish I don't know I think they're pretty good I don't know if they're worth a hundred dollars but I'll give these pierogies a four out of five okay one solid lump I bet this would have tasted great with sour cream and and the with the horseradish what have you I should I should look up how much extra that is let's find out it's twenty dollars extra look at that smug face he knows he's getting away with murder Cleveland is oh my kind of town show my is Cleveland really as bad as they say it is no we have very few Factory player deaths yeah that's looking like tuna fish ma would you perhaps like to do the honors of counting us down in three two one let's sausage [Music] a little over the top but you know everyone does it differently you crank it and I'll give it a tug am I Cricket at the which one nope nope okay there we go anytime you crank it that's the way you crank it as looks like giant poop oh there's still a lot of pierogies left in there we can't leave them hanging you know I met a guy from Cleveland once really yeah he wanted to
