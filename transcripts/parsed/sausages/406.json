"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess come on it's it's the Shake Shack white truffle Burger as as you can see and it looks absolutely disgusting isn't this there it is all the onion rings are right there oh my God not really a great start to this Shake Shack uh uh sausage here you know everything doesn't look uh great I thought Shake Shack was supposed to be Gourmet the box that came in is more impressive than the burger but you know let's do our due diligence here and give it a try if you were debating whether or not to get this sandwich go to McDonald's instead that's a very unimpressive burger right there Shake Shack is what happens when you spend all your money on marketing and none of it on the actual food hey we make burgers look cool mediocre Burgers but impressive marketing well I I did have high hopes for this burger but then I tried it and now I'm thinking that this is probably gonna be like a two out of five these Burgers cost so much money it doesn't taste any better than a a three day old hamburger foreign do we really need more fancy burger restaurants I mean really what's the difference between Shake Shack and and Smashburger it's the it's the exact same thing what if we offered people milkshakes with their burgers McDonald's does that already there's no there's no reason for this to exist I'm calling it now in five years there will be no more Shake Shack but Mr Sausage you don't understand if these burgers are more expensive and therefore better there's no such thing as a gourmet burger girl put your sausage on tell me your favorite song you go ahead let your hair down in three two one let's Josh it looks like dog do that's turned white from baking in the sun oh but our beef comes from antibiotic free cows well if it doesn't taste any better than a normal burger then who cares Which special thanks to today's Mark box a little box artist this guy look at the detail in three two one with sausage once more impressive work but will it blow all right we got we got a hit the other part fell right on the floor well not much to that will it Blow although it did hit with a with a with a satisfying thump so I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow to mark ruffalage here we go it smells marginally worse but let's open it up and see how we did oh whoa what a mess well I guess okay let's try that again it looks a little dull it looks it looks a little flavorless in there let's go ahead and give it a try perfect shot here we go it tastes like the the meat that they scrape off the grill which isn't necessarily bad but in this case it is I can taste a little bit of those onion straws in there but but none of the white truffle what have you made it I can't taste the cheese it it overwhelmingly tastes like scraped up hamburger from the from the flat top grill there but you know it's got a good crunch it's got a good uh sear to it you know those are two positive things that you can say about this uh the rest is that it looks like Duty I think my original prediction was right on the money with this one so I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a two out of five pop the last time I had a Shake Shack Burger was right before a flight from Vegas and I swore to myself never again "
