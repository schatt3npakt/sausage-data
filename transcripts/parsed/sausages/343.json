"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess well we got some marinated olives today and they've been pre-pitted no pits going in the grinder we got some big blocks of feta to go along with it i'm predicting this is gonna be a five out of five and i will fight anyone in the comments who who who disagrees with that but i digress we're here to turn these olives into mush that's going to make a fine ingredient right there you know we're going to have a good time cube that fat up good because it'll wrap around your grinder blade like like like a big piece of fat round two [Applause] olives are pretty salty as it is so so we're gonna just just hit it with a little bit of salt and make up the difference in pepper i think the feta cheese may introduce some logistical issues this is probably the most exquisite sausage ever made take a look at my sausage she's the only one i got and three two one let's josh [Music] uh this this is this is a long one this is one this is one of the longer sausages this is probably an inappropriate occasion to to link these sausages up so we we got we got about four almost equally sized sausages which special thanks to today's mark boxalo box artist this guy i gotta say this is this is one of my favorite box arts ever it's uncanny you can show this to anyone and they'd be like oh yeah that's mark ruffalo so will it blow oh we missed him we were a little high but that was a good one that was a that was a pretty good one so i'm gonna have to give that will it boil four mark ruffalos we got we got our we got our broken burner here still works we're just gonna stick this flammable paper towel right there to even that out here we go all right i feel confident that these are cooked all the way let's open up uh one of them and see how we did oh oh it's olivier it's it's porky it's feta cheesy let's go ahead and try a bite remember i got a big bet on this one this is i'm i'm guessing five out of five the whole way okay here we go a few thoughts about this sausage even though there was i'll say minimal olives in there this thing tastes 100 like pure marinated olives it's it's a strong flavor we could have cut down the amount of olives we used in half and and that would have been plenty it's a hard sausage to swallow um well so it's a good thing that i didn't bet any real money on this sausage because i would have lost a boatload i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 3 out of 5. all right and now it's you now it's time to try to mix it i guess i mean that's what we're doing isn't it "
