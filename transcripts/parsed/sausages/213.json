"well hey there folks and uh welcome back [Music] i guess scotch eggs or as they call them in scotland eggs we're also going to speed this episode up by using a pre-made uh sausage you know that looks that looks uh that looks like sausage so it's the uh the skeleton sausage flower thank you eggs this looks like this looks better than any sausage we've made on the show get in there with your hands i always forget to take the wedding ring off it's it's it's been in many many a sausage and then we just kind of roll it up like a little like a little baby these are these are baseball-sized scotch eggs here we gotta maintain the integrity of of the egg shape here i i shoulda i should have sprung for the bigger balls on this episode that was not too much oil well all right let's you know open up and see the fruits of our labor here and there you go try a bite of the fruits of our labor here well of of all the eggs i've ever had this one is certainly the most that's been surrounded by sausage how'd this other guy do oh yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh ninja sausage sausage for me three two one let's josh will it blow oh it solidly went behind the backboard there and as you can see yeah it's it's clearly behind we're gonna have to pull the stove out well sure i'm gonna have to give that two mark ruffalos let's open it up and see how we did well it looks like sausage with pieces of egg in it here we go and it tastes like sausage with pieces of egg in it basically what we did here was just you know make a sausage i should have thought that one through so there's nothing really spectacular about this uh you know being deep fried and having panko crumbs and all that so i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a three out of five i gotta say of of all the eggs i've ever had this is the most labor-intensive "
