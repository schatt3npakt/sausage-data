quick bite okay so uh here it is it's uh you know practically the same thing except now it's got hog casing on it so that's the difference so here we go it does taste a little bit better with the hog casing i'm not gonna lie i don't it tastes just a little bit better just just just just a little bit but there's no must what about mustard and like i could put your you have some mustard on it yeah

what what's the misses sausage score where'd you get it i gave it a five out of five a three a three a solid three i think it was better i think i think it was better without all that buys by on its own and plus i've been into it it's like it's like the the meat's not like adhering or sticking to the casing so it's like you've got it's like a water balloon so that's why the juice came out because
