"we're here folks and uh welcome back i guess i i didn't even know aloe vera was edible i thought it was just something you put on a sunburn i don't know you can eat it it's not poisonous so not being poisonous is a very good reason to make a sausage out of it and so that's what we're gonna do there's all that aloe vera goodness a thousand apologies for for you know not representing aloe vera properly [Music] it's itchy it's super slippery i can't get a hold of it all right let's give this a a taste test here we go [Music] all right i it doesn't really taste much of anything it's very watery and and taste it like a cucumber has more flavor than than this and the more room temperature it gets the more it's turning into into goose but we'll just pre-put this all in the measuring cup oh my god oh that was a good plop i think the port to aloe vera ratio is going to be way off on this one oh jesus okay this this this isn't this isn't this isn't really going as planned it's kind of awful i've seen enough this is this is getting way out of hand [Music] oh oh god we don't we don't we won't oh shoot we don't we don't need this much aloe vera my god what have i done nothing that a little shelf can't take care of and pepper we'll we'll hit this with a little bit of ground cumin as well it has the consistency of the brain episode everything's getting worse about this uh you know this this is you this is heading towards zero territory i came in like a shawshank ball that was quick how hard is it in three two one let's shush this is this is this is this is looking pretty dang gross it's it's it's climbing the tube you know it'll burst when you when you do that you know a high probability of bursting today's will it blow is brought to you by this guy wow they got them all in there didn't they they got the ruffalo scar they got the lit sausage the big sausage and the little sausage i think uh yeah they think they got them all in there amazing work and i i think i'll shave this one for when mrs sausage goes out of town so uh will it blow yeah uh you know it did i get you good will it blow i'm gonna have to give that will it blow four mark ruffalos here we go we got a burst we got a little burst it's it's turning into a big burst it's like a a jet popping in slow motion this sausage has been cooking for like 20 minutes and it and it still looks very uncooked we're gonna say that that's cooked you know i have to say for bursting it held together pretty well so uh let's let's open up this uh conundrum and and see how we did well at the at the very least we can say it's cooked there's still plenty of aloe vera in there to to to make this sausage worthwhile okay here we go unbelievable it's actually very good it's very very good i think adding the cumin in at the last second really saved this sausage it tastes refreshing i guess it it tastes like a clean sausage i don't know i it it it feels healthy for some reason that the aloe vera is in there it tastes healthy i'm dumbfounded i thought this would taste like trash of course the the texture is is a mess so that's you know gotta be worked on but the flavor-wise it's it's a home run for me but we'll deduct the usual point for it you know being you know what uh so i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 4 out of 5. you "
