"[Music] well hey there folks and welcome back I guess to yet and even another special episode of the sausage video program a lot of people in the comments wanted me to help Charlie out and give him some guidance on how to improve his sausage making so we'll go over to footage and see what advice I can give them oh and by the way we still will be making sausage on this episode as well as trying one of his the KFC big bucket well that was supposed to be sausage casing but I feel like I've been stabbed they've got intestines that's what sausage casing is it's the intestine loss that's good that's good tearing technique when you're shoving the food down the chute system we need to really want it really learn you know the breading can be a cruel mistress he didn't want it bad enough this is this is looking good this is looking like what we had on our show still left with a usable amount they sell a sausage attachment look at that I've never seen this method of sausage in before about holding your first sausage is exactly like holding your new this is why we're out of keeping topic is linked on our show well we've certainly made worst-looking sausages on the program so well not a total success this this isn't a total failure either well there you have it we're going to dream infer that it's a 5 out of 5 sausage yeah you make sure you get it nice and overloaded beyond its capacity and if that's the secret that most sausages won't tell all the I like to tell you the truth it looks about the same as before a way once all right there you have it folks I think it's about time we give it a try on our show I say enough of the pleasantries ooh let's get down to some sausages I was not anticipating this odd hey Callie did we really accomplish anything by sticking this in the grinder and I I would have to say no this is so loose you know if this was my recipe I would probably crumble up some graham crackers try to thicken this up because this is gonna be a really jiggly sausage this is Charlie's recipe so we're not gonna mess with it we're gonna stick it into the casing just the way it is and who knows maybe maybe it'll be like the cake sausage and it'll be a nice surprise this is the piece that Charlie was missing why his grinder kept falling off the KitchenAid there well I actually put on [Music] you know I'm hoping that I don't get be monetized for this one [Music] calling this one sausage give it a little twist how about that yeah all right we got about four sausages out of that I say we put them in the pan and watch embarrassed here goes nothing I don't know how I did that I can't believe it folks it's a it's actually working well normally on the show this would be the point where I cut open the sausage and what you see what it looks like inside but I think we can see what it looks like on the inside so we'll just go straight to the tasting well this kind of looks like the pickle so the guy in the comments who keeps wanting pickle sausage I mean this is practically gonna be the same thing eh eh and in good game in good show prep fashion Iran I didn't buy any hotdog buns so we have this piece of bread here let's give it a taste though oh it just all kind of squirt it out the end all right we're gonna try to get one good bite out of this this is this is not a 5 out of 5 here this is this is a 0 out of 5 I think the compressed grass taste it's it's even more so now it is not good sausage making material this is the bit but it bursts on the other end you know maybe there's a better way to cook this I certainly don't want to try it again bop bop either you know the secret might be to cook it before it goes into the sausage it's getting really sticky now that's just what I said rectum "
