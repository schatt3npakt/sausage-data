"well hey there folks and y'all welcome back I guess we got some competition today if memory serves we did White Castle sliders and those got a five out of five also this store was only selling the party pack so I have like a ton of these cheeseburger bites where's my money Caruso let's give one a little chopsy Doodle see what it looks like while it's still frozen you know uh I don't know what I expected yes my my suspicions are correct it is filled with meat and cheese nine minutes okay yeah all right well I'll see you in nine minutes there they are you know they look like your standard you know Tostitos pizza roll but how do they look on the inside a try shall we they kind of sort of taste like White Castle they they taste more like cheeseburgers you get at the gas station really the shell doesn't taste like a White Castle bun but the inside of it short it tastes like White Castle so on a scale of one to ten of how much this tastes like a White Castle cheeseburger slider I'd give this probably like a six but how does it taste like a sausage me together used to be getting the cheeseburger haul [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] well no no regretting necessary on this one this one's pure mush cheeseburger and Paradise I like mine with sausage and Fries just up in three two one let's just change this is this one's this one's difficult well that's it that's how we're gonna get all that beige isn't indicating to me that this is not going to be a very flavorful sausage it's a sticky boy this one's sticking with special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy what a collage we have here you got Charlie's o face right in the center I have a feeling though that this thing ain't gonna blow but well I blow no it's basically cement in there but we'll like throw yay a disappointment all around except this except the beautiful box yard so I'm gonna have to give that will it blow no Mark ruffalos I'm sorry I let you down and we'll be cooking this in the fires in which it was originally forged in 375 for like 10 minutes it's it's still not quite done another 10 minutes that was a 30 minute cook time but boy does that look good well I can tell you one thing the skin is mighty crispy so well you know let's open it up and see how we did it doesn't look too flavorful in there does it well all right let's let's try this thing here we go yeah as as predicted there's there's not too much flavor in this thing it tastes mostly like the Tostitos outer shell and and that's about it a little hint of cheese a little hint of of of gas station hamburger this doesn't hold a candle at all to the original White Castle slider sausage I am impressed with the way that the toaster oven cooked these sausages so so we may be doing that for more bread-based sausages in the future so I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a one out of five pop [Applause] "
