"this episode of ordinary sausage is brought to you by bright sellers now you may not consider me the most intellectual person when it comes to wine i used to buy my wine at walgreens or cvs you could go to a grocery store you could go to a liquor store and you'll be completely lost in the wall of wines that they have you don't know what you want go to the bright sellers website take the quiz and and they'll give you wine that you'll actually want you tell bright sellers i i like puppies but i also like to eat a bag of skittles and they'll be like oh well then obviously a cabernet is is what you should be drinking of course my favorite wine is the pinot noir [Music] and the best thing about bright chillers is they include these special cards in the packaging so you can sound like you know what you're talking about when you invite your friends over this pinot noir also has aromas of rose petals and baking spices that carry over to the palate yeah you can smell the strawberries well sponsors like bright sellers help keep the channel going so go ahead and buy a couple boxes and brightsellers is giving my followers 50 off their first six bottle box you can get all of this for just 55. i like the lighter wines the wider the white ones now of course the first thing you need for sangria is fruit that's about to go bad i i can't explain it myself i'm i'm pretty sure this is how they make wine in prison i think you can just use whatever fruit you got that whatever fruit that's about to expire we're gonna just jam-pack this thing with as much fruit as we can a little strawberry action too [Music] who doesn't love a good strawberry drink and we'll throw in a lime just just so that we can say that we did that now i think we got some sangria fruit going here our fruit medley's pretty fruity at this point let's finish this off by dumping in the wine now if you're going for a traditional sangria you should be using a spanish red wine but we're going to be using pinot noir since that's my favorite kind of wine and i read that you can just substitute it out with that anyway so we're not breaking any laws we'll just dump some brown sugar in it to up that sweetness that's a pretty half full pitcher of wine so we're going to be opening up another one of these bright cellar wines to help round out this this picture this one's called rising tail and it's also a pinot noir and it's got uh you know it's got you know half the stuff that we put in the picture already it's got you know some strawberries and well i guess it's just strawberries now that's looking like some sangria it's time to sweeten up this wine give it a mighty stir give it a little taste test oh yeah that's that that's the stuff all right but of course we're not here to make sangria we're here to make sangria sausage time to load up the pork and then enjoy and end there gotta put the pork in the sangria if you want to make me scream bro i don't i don't know i don't know if there's enough room for all this pork it's a little too much here well we we gotta drink some of this you mix the pork in you mix the pork out you mix the pork in and you screw it all up and that's what it's all about right foot all right i'm gonna put this in the freezer for a few minutes make sure that pork is still firm when we throw it in the grinder well we it it turns out pork doesn't freeze in an alcohol based solution so we're just gonna have to try our best [Music] oh okay oh it was plugged up it was plugged up this is gonna be an awful sausage a little seasoning the last thing you want to say is boy i wish that sangria sausage had some salt in it i don't practice sangria i that's looking like some fine sausaging material you know i i bet the ancient romans they they probably ate sausages just like this the decadence all right in three two one let's josh this is going to be one leaky sausage i'm just warning everyone in advance man the ruffalo box is getting nasty it's been nasty but now it's now it's starting to smell once again thank you bright sellers for this will it blow oh that was a tasty will it blow uh it looks like we got a piece on the sausage art that's you know not something that we try to do i'm gonna have to give that will it blow four mark ruffalos all right it's it's a drippy boy it's it's it's hard to it's it's unwieldy all right here we go it's starting to look veiny think this sausage is is as cooked as it's gonna get let's let's let's open it up and uh see how we did [Music] uh so far so good it it you know it looks cooked ever so lovingly place it in the bun sangria sausage here we go it's a it's it's overpowering the fruit rinds are are taking hold of this sausage and they're not letting go it tastes like everclear is what this sausage tastes like it's it's it's it's it's quite strong you know you gotta take risks when you're making sausage maybe we shouldn't have put the fruit rinds in maybe there was too much liquid when we started the skin cooked for like 20 minutes and still it's as slippery as the devil himself it was a fun sausage to make not a fun sausage to eat thanks again to brightsellers for sponsoring this episode i'm going to have to give this sausage here a 1 out of 5. everyone loves sangria especially if you're a woman in her 40s "
