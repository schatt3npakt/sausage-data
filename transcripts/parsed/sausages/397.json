"but hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess Sports Peppers it's coming up a lot in the in the sausage Quest comments uh uh people don't know what sports peppers are so just exactly what is a sports pepper once you come here to learn something or see something turned into a sausage uh but I digress the first page of Google tells me that these are just generic chilies that are no longer than an inch and a half that are then pickled in vinegar they're mildly hot and it's only uses for topping hot dogs in Chicago the million steps to opening this so there it is so why do people from Chicago top their hot dogs with this pepper in particular I I don't know does it say Professor sausage anywhere in my bio the husk of it's pretty pretty strong it's pretty tough and it provides a nice little crunch with your hot dog now now look we could do this sausage right and just use the sports pepper Peppers or we can do it wrong and use all that juice my vote is for doing it wrong you know the bowl is the real unsung hero of the kitchen so that was like all the all the juice in two of the sports Peppers get out oh yeah now that I think about it why didn't I just put it all in the grinder oh okay it's already dripping out somewhat some would say this method is flawed from the start [Music] foreign [Music] can you hear it can you hear the noises do you believe in God Chaka ooga chaka ooga ooga ooga chaka foreign [Music] yep that's the pork and vinegar Sports pepper water three two one let's just there's so much liquid that the juice is sagging to the bottom all right we managed to get five modestly sized sausages out of that tell you what I'm just gonna poke the one in the middle because this is gonna be one leaky sausage Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy again this guy's officially contributed more to the show than Mrs sausage what's going on with our nipples so will it blow Charlotte Charlotte hit so I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow three Mark ruffalos and now for a pop quiz due to the overwhelming amount of liquid in these sausages what is the best method of cooking is it a pan sear is it B cooking it in the toaster oven is it C boiling it or is it D crying in the corner from anxiety of another sausage bursting what more do they want well we're almost halfway done and and as predicted they're leaking like like like uh something that leaks a lot Good Golly Miss Molly that's a lot of juice there's like no no conceivable way to get this out of there without making a huge an even bigger mess and there it goes oh I think I felt the plate crack oh for sure it did my plate cracked no matter how many times I do this I always forget about the shrinkage but die our method worked we got some nice hot crispy sausages here it did it appears it didn't matter if they were uh poked or not they all they all made it without bursting all right so you know let's uh here we'll open up one of these dinky ones that's a peppery one no one can argue you're not getting peppers in this sausage just just shove it right in there here we go it's remarkably good well of course it's spicy because of the sports Peppers but the sports Peppers also provide such a great crunch to the to the meat this is much better than jalapeno looks pretty tasty I mean if it wasn't already chewed on but you know it imagine if it I can't think of any reasons to dock at any point it's vinegary it's spicy it's just a great tasting sausage so I guess the only choice I have is to give this sausage here a five out of five pop that you're in love with sausage I said I'm hooked on a sausage "
