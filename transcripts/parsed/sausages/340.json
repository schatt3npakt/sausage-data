"what hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess ever since the arby's wagyu sausage people have been requesting that i make more sausages without without pork in it and just just use the uh oh there's no bag this is all i figured fish sticks would be the the perfect one uh to do that the breading outside of the fish stick should be plenty enough to uh to soak up all the water that's contained inside of the minced fish well what what more can be said they're frozen pieces of fish without further ado let's let's let's get on with it [Music] [Applause] now i was gonna say if this can't handle minced fish what what what good is it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] this is gonna make a lot of sausage they come running just as fast as they can cause every girl's crazy about a sausage man this may not be as much sausage as as i originally thought it's a very slow moving sausage in three two one let shawsh that's all the sausage we're getting out of this thing today which special thanks to today's mark box hello box artist this guy you know i'll be the first to say it i think that these things are getting way out of hand so will it blow okay we we we gotta hit it mostly disintegrated it uh there's there's part of it here's another part oh i show uh you know i'll uh i i'm i'm gonna have to give that will it blow two mark ruffalo it it looks a great deal like cat puke and sausage casing here we go well okay i think i think that's as cooked as that's that's gonna get so let's get it out of the pan all right let's open this up and and see how we did looks like a looks like a bunch of fish sticks in there okay here we go well this shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone but but this sausage is great it's got a crispy skin outside a little mushy on the inside but you know what what do you expect that's that's what fish sticks are like inside as far as fish sticks sausages go this is probably the best outcome we could have hoped for very potatoy on the inside which which isn't you know necessarily a bad thing but but a little bit firmer texture on the inside would have been a five out of five so yeah great flavor great color great crunch on the skin i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 4 out of 5. you know it's always uh it's always a big mistake to to throw it all out there on the board because i got to clean it up anyway "
