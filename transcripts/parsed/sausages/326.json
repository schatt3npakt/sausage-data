"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess well it's it's the new arby's steak steakhouse wagyu burger thing and right away it looks delicious before we get to the sausaging let's let's take an actual look at what's under the hood more mayonnaise than you can possibly imagine two slices of tomato it used to have shredded lettuce on it but i think most of it you know fell out of the side here and then you got the uh what appears to be cheese then then you got the wagyu patty itself here and that was put that right there and then you got uh yep even more mayonnaise and uh your onions and pickles and then the bottom of the bun you know we're not talking about it let's let's see how this is it is good this is a this is a home run for arby's i'd say it tastes like it doesn't come from a fast food restaurant is is probably the highest praise i could give this burger it's it's very good easily this burger's a five out of five but we're not here to to judge arby's quality of food we're here to make sausage out of it priming the grinder is you know that's a very important step it looks like a buffet for the senses you know if someone painted this it would be a modern art masterpiece i just want you to hold my little sauce sedge send me on my way send me on my way in three two one let's josh [Music] i believe we've reached the end it looks like a fiesta of fun in there is this one stickier than normal with special thanks to today's mark box hello box artist this guy show will it blow us a solid hit it you know it it hit it hit with with a fair amount but it also you know it dropped logs pretty pretty early so i'm gonna have to give that will it blow one mark ruffalo's here we go [Music] oh no yo yo we gotta burst okay we're getting we gotta get this out of the pan no no this thing bursts like a son of a gun uh but the good news is we still have a a cooked sausage on our hands here we'll just scoop that over here just adding more bread to the bread okay here we go wow i ripped off the whole thing you know hot lettuce is is a big detriment to to to sausages working i'm giving you we got to scrape lettuce off whenever they're on hamburgers from now on uh because this this would be a tasty sausage i'll be at you know squishy it's a it's a squishy one uh it kind of tastes like the big mac sausage even after all these years i could i can still remember the taste it it was a detriment to this hamburger to turn it into a sausage so i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 3 out of 5. if you don't like arby's roast beef well who doesn't like harvey's roast beef but if you don't care for the roast beef i'd say that this sandwich is a is the perfect sandwich for you to go uh try arby's "
