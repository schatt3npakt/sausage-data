"oh my God it's not coming off and we'll just paint over it well hey there folks and welcome back I guess look what Mrs sausage found at the Goodwill guy fet's food cooking it living it loving it if you ask me she overpaid by $22.99 it would have been a better value finding it in the dumpster but irregardless it's the season of turkey and what better way to mess up Thanksgiving than to cook a meal designed by Guy Fetti himself where is it and there we go that's what we're going to be making today oh and only five steps that's a good amount of steps six more is way out of line okay so the first thing that we have to do is prep all this stuff oh jeez none of that none of that stayed on Okay I uh oh wait we we still got to do the turkey cook turkey breast what no wonder why there's only five steps he skipped like half the steps doesn't even say how to season it some salt some pepper and a little garlic are there any other steps that you left out guys Yeti like do I need to Milk The Cow for the cream of course it's going to be only five steps when you don't mention that you got to cook half the food before you start I've been at this for about 30 minutes and we're not even at step one all right start your timers cuz we're ready to finally start we're still on step two doesn't say a single thing about seasoning any of this stuff by the way the only thing that's getting salt is the water I was too lazy to Minch this garlic myself how isn't one and three the same step and step four is to pour tequila around the edge of the pan to deglaze it but it doesn't mention anything about about taking the stuff out of the pan first I'm going to dump it out in this bowl you know what kind of bowl that is and this calls to deglaze with an ounce of tequila which you know I'm no mathematician no one can figure that out then add a half a cup of heavy cream it smells like tequila cooked in heavy cream are we ever going to introduce any spices to this we do need to add the lemon juice and a little bit of cilantro add some salt to it God it's like it's like it's like if Mrs sausage wrote this can you imagine tossing this fetuccini with all that garbage in the pan give it the old parmesan cheese treatment okay so final step is to Nest the pasta on a serving plate slops on everybody and it says to finish it off with some cracked black pepper and lime Wes the freshly cracked black pepper isn't going to save this you know what would I don't know maybe using more more than one spice uh uh looks okay let's give it a little taste test here it's too much black pepper it tastes like someone's uncle was drunk in the kitchen I write the recipe a three out of five but will it taste better in sausage form not at the Finish Line don't do me a don't don't do it at the Finish Line oh that piece of turkey is now floor turkey it kind of just looks like ground turkey wouldn't it be amazing if this turned out well that's me in the corner that's me in the spotlight losing my sausages in three two one BL sausage that's uh that's a whole lot of extra you know to do all that work just to end up with a sausage this big is kind of disappointing with special thanks to today's

drunken turkey whatever the heck that was so I'm going to have to give that will it blow half a Ruffalo also known as a full-size fi Yeti if you get it you get it here we [Music] go okay looks pretty done to me the score to beat is three let's open it up and see how we did oh I caught the mic with that one it looks mushy okay here we go despite all the odds despite all the bad recipe instructions this turned out to be a great sausage I can taste the turkey the peppers the tequila sauce it's uh it's all very good turning it into a sausage was a great Improvement um I'll I'll I'll I'll subtract one point just cuz it's mushy but you know it's it's noodles we've never had a we've never had a noodle sausage come out not mushy so you know that was to be expected uh but overall I'm impressed all right so you know what instead of throwing this directly in the garbage I think that uh I think we'll I think we'll keep this I can't I can't get the sticker off but I'm still not going to give that spiky haired freaking apology so I'm going to have to give this sausage here a four out of five take me away go "
