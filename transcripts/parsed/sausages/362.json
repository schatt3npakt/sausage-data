"we're here folks and uh welcome back I guess well let's fall once again and what better way to celebrate fall than getting blitzed on Hard Apple Cider sausages just like Grandma used to do but before we get into into the sausages oh choppy ain't what it used to be we gotta we gotta we gotta sharpen this knife good news and bad news today the store had pork butt but they they had bone-in pork butt we gotta get that bone out of there this style is good for like pulled pork but if you want to make sausages you gotta deal with that bone oh yeah look at this just tearing away at it look at that I should have sharpened this then years ago that's bony all right that wasn't so bad that took about five minutes we're not gonna use all this this this is enough for quite a bit of sausaging in our future yep that's a big pile of chopped up meat if you watched last Friday's episode you know what a big debacle that was because we didn't have our meat frozen enough so we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna put some of this in a bag and we're and we're gonna freeze it and then we're gonna grind it we got our partially frozen meat here some of it feels a little firm some of it doesn't so we're gonna see how that goes yeah there's a log of me it appears we could have used a little bit more time in the freezer but it was in there for like an hour God it looks like rain from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles where this is this is totally getting a regrind by the way oh freaking come on now and back in the grinder you're going who knows what horrible shape will come out of there now this is like bad idea to worse idea partially Frozen's not good enough well Shucks you know you win some you lose some people just gonna segue right into this part well of course it's gonna be soaked in this angry orchard stuff but we're also going to boil it in it I'll show you a trick I learned in the sausage Marines how about that foreign this looks like a pretty successful Saturday night out I'm gonna let this marinate for like an hour all right we're back an hour later and not much has changed although it has solidified quite a bit it looks like the absorption has really taken hold that means holding on to it really good but don't worry plenty of this liquid's still going to come out when we press this sausage all the sausages are brown Josh and the sausage is gray and the sausage is great foreign wow really not that much liquid came out it's like everything that I said would happen in this episode the exact opposite has happened all right then in three two one let's Shawshank oh and dice and that's it that's all the casing I got this has been a very wet experience sure sausages out of that I'm gonna poke half of them and see if the other half blows up Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy look at that look how look how great he looks so will it blow oh yes right in the eye and also surrounded the Box pretty good so I'm gonna have to give that will a blow five Mark ruffalo's it's no time like the present to get this party started and one more these probably would have unraveled by themselves so I went ahead and tied some butcher's twine around each one ah well all right uh here we go well things are things are coming along I guess well it it looks like we got one or two bursts in there and now we just gotta hope that the whole thing doesn't Burst when we take it out ow ah well results are inconclusive these must be the four that I didn't poke and of course the skin isn't crispy but we you know we have a cure for that let's do this one and uh let's you know let's let's take a bite it's not it's not really bad at all it's it's um it ha it has a little bit of of apple cider taste to it it doesn't have that strong alcohol flavor to it like the tequila sausage and the um in the sangria sausage it's it's pretty it's pretty good remember we we only flavored this with the with the with the hard cider there was no salt or Pepper or anything the skin does crisp up when we hit it with the flame throwers so that's great news I'm gonna have to give these sausages here a three out of five pop how loud can this get oh yeah "
