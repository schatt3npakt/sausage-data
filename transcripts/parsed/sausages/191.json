"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess you know i i have i have some real high hopes for this sausage it's gonna have hot avocados in it and way more garlic than the recipe calls for there's no pot of of boiling oil in this episode so it can only go well enough with the talking and more to making things into sausage ah so it's the guacamole all right the first thing we gotta do is everyone's favorite activity we gotta chop the ingredients starting with mincing half an onion and putting it in a bowl then chop a tomato and your cilantro and also put those things in a bowl take three avocados and you're not gonna believe what i'm about to tell you but you're gonna peel those avocados and also put them in a bowl squeeze a lime in a bowl and then put that lime juice that is in the small bowl into the big bowl ruin the shot by shoving your fat hands right in the way of what people need to see and then don't correct it at all yeah stick your hands in there you idiot then skip the small bowls all together and stick the garlic straight into the avocado bowl oh and also the cilantro can go in now stir add the onions and the tomatoes and stir again add some salt to taste as well as cayenne pepper and then stir it one last time well i've seen better guac but what really matters here is how does it taste well that's some good guacamole let's throw it in the grinder this step has literally no purpose to the process whatsoever everything is gonna be all right sausage bye i'm thinking this is enough sausage casing how much guacamole sausage can i really eat put this right back on here give it a little and look at that no more accidents this is a silly sausage three two one let's just [Music] you know there's probably way more guacamole sausage than one person needs will it blow you know it it kind of blew i'm gonna have to give that will it blow three mark ruffalos not available you know in fact i think this helps us cook the rest of the sausage yeah it's just getting soggier are you burst oh it's a it bursts it's completely burst i can't remember the last time we had a sausage fail this this badly on the show look at this thing or don't look at this thing this thing's a monstrosity here you go just everything everything's gonna be okay here we go there we go on paper this sausage sounded really neat but in practice it's a total bust let's go ahead and give this a shot shall we i'm spitting out so hot avocado is is is is is not good by all accounts this is a terrible sausage obviously it's disqualified because it it it didn't make it but if it wasn't disqualified it would most certainly get a zero out of five so there it is that's the end of this episode final score disqualified buh you "
