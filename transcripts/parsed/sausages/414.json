"well hey there folks and uh welcome back I guess today we're making 2x pot roast sausage I had a dream in which we we solved one of this Channel's biggest problems which is turning beef into a sausage that doesn't taste like hamburger there we go so I came up with an idea we're gonna cook half of this pot roast and we're gonna use that as seasoning for the other uncooked half if that makes sense including the vegetables so we'll divvy up the vegetables in half as well and sure it it you may be saying it's probably not a good idea to mix you know raw beef with cooked beef but uh what are you the beef police I mean the the beef should cook down during the cooking process so it's it should this should work I based that on no evidence whatsoever and like with any good pot roast we're gonna we're gonna season it first sear it on all sides and then we'll throw it in the the pressure cooker sit on my cat and we're gonna save the other half for the raw portion foreign we'll let this go for for 30 minutes we'll we'll get this prepared into cubes and and throw it in the freezer for a little bit so that the grinder doesn't get all jammed up with all that hot hot meat this is either the dumbest idea I've ever had or the best idea I've ever had there will be no in between we're looking for a five out of five on this one God this is taking forever all a party well all right it's grinder time then it's time for the raw beef and the raw vegetables what a mess of of deliciousness I am being blocked by a carrot oh oh my God [Music] oh okay oh we're running out of room foreign this hard to believe but this is going exactly as I pictured it this part not so much I'm I I'm I I have I I no longer know what to think about this I wanna take shelter from the poison ring where the sausage has no name no God it's a big boy take a guess what kind of water that is that's the pot roast water and the one let's just say undefined right at the Finish Line you know originally I was gonna pan share this but seeing just how wet it is I I think it's more appropriate that we throw it in the toaster oven Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy oh I got some water on it sorry about that that really does look like Mark Ruffalo this will it Blow is brought to you by raycon does the thought of paying for overpriced earbuds give you instant diarrhea it

riding on this one here we go it's pretty good it definitely could use some salt and pepper in there but um it definitely tastes like a pot roast it's holding together but you you can you can see you know you can you can see the texture of that that's that's not it's not great I think we were we were somewhat successful in this it it does not taste anything like a hamburger it is it is 100 pot roast flavor in there just some salt and pepper would probably have cleaned this up quite a bit we are however doing a little bit better than the cat food sausage which which is something so on this day we we don't we don't leave the battlefield totally Victorious I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a three and a half out of five pop just just for once for once just come on now "
