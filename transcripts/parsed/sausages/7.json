"[Music] what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] what the hey there folks welcome back to another one of these sorry that my voice sounds a little funny today I am getting over a cold but you know what they say time and sausages wait for no man and if you haven't guessed it already we're good we're gonna be doing a dessert sausage a very popular demand in the comment section it's a my prediction that there's no way that this is going to turn out well pork and sweets really don't go that well together and some of you may say hey hey look at the you know the design on there but you know I'm a I'm a sausage maker I'm not a cake decorator I'm actually saving this piece for later yeah probably shouldn't turn this thing on before we started but you know [Laughter] good god so the texture of this feels exclusively like frosting doesn't feel like cake at all and this actually makes me kind of nervous because when we push down on it with the press it's going to compact even more I'm hoping to just get one sausage out of this and there's a lot here at ways quite a bit ok it's time for the moment of truth here oh no oh that's a fail right there that's the first time that's happened on this show we burst while making it you know we're not we're not going to let this go to waste we're going to cut it off and throw it in and hope it doesn't happen to the next one okay we're just gonna keep going like that didn't even happen yeah you know I think this is why you don't see too many cakes sausages around so we managed to get five sausages out of a 28-ounce cake we would have had six but I ran out of casing at the very end so but you know I thought it would only be one and we got five so let's count our blessings I was gonna do low and slow on this but I think it's better just to get it really hot and out of the pan as quick as possible before these things have a chance to split so here we go a quick flash fry all I didn't like that either that was a bad idea no I don't don't flash fry dogs out I lower temperature not even sizzling okay there's some considerable shrinkage here get a little bit early shot there they're about half the size they were before they went in there but we did get it cooked still extremely jiggly it kind of feels like a custard but you know we'll see how it tastes well all right I guess it's the moment of truth time to taste this cake sausage it may be kind of boring for you guys to look at an empty plate so here's here's what was left in the pan I can't give this one rave enough reviews it kind of tastes like a funnel cake it's really delicious I'm gonna give this a four out of five and not a five out of five because of the spillage that we had once we figure out how to keep the cake inside of the sausage this is going to be for sure a 5 out of 5 bop bop [Music] "
