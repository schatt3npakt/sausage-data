"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess if we're gonna make a key lime pie yeah we we should also try to make a uh cork and key lime pie as well so it's it's the key lime pie sausage [Music] [Music] in terms of how i expected this to come out this was not in any of the options boy i'm certainly glad someone had the foresight to throw a pork down this thing [Music] you got to mix in that key lime flavor actually starting to look like a ham salad baby come back you can blame it all on me in three two one let's shush sausaging has gone awry what the heck happened this this is a conundrum will it blow how that was that that blue all right let's give this train wreck it's fair shake these are the only two to survive this one is entirely key lime pie this one is the pork and key lime pie and that's all we really need it's just unfortunate that we have that much waste when making two sausages uh key lime pie sausage i'm gonna go for the end that's most done very pleasant flavor it's uh um it tastes like a really rich key lime pie uh it's very dense i i would give that a two out of five now let's let's now let's move on to the here there we go so now let's move on to the to the pork and key lime pie and uh hopefully we we can get a better score uh out of that so uh here we i don't know which end we should here we'll go with this and hey here we go no no no these are just two flavors that are just not working i gotta spit it out each time so zero for the for the pork and key lime pie but but a surprising a two out of five for the uh just normal key lime pie so we're going to go with that score we're going to go with a a 2 out of 5. we have more fan mail to open so we have uh a stuffed animal that's all right looks like we got some uh some ashtrays mrs sausage and myself don't smoke but uh we will be using these as uh drink coasters "
