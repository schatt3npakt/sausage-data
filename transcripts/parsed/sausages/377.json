"we're hating a folks and uh welcome back I guess well it's been a while since we dusted off the old smoker oh my God and yeah you know thanksgiving's right around the corner what better opportunity to I smoke a turkey breast since it's since no one eats it any other time of the year all right the first thing we're the first thing we got to do is uh you know find out why this is black and get rid of the rest of the skin with it it comes it it comes mostly right off with just a little bit of as far as uh turkey breast go this one's this one's pretty small so I I don't think we'll have to smoke it for too long I think maybe a two-hour smoke is what we're looking at and we'll be using a two to one ratio of black pepper to shout so two parts black pepper one part shelf first I'm gonna inject it with this Tony's Tony's Cha-Cha Slide injectable roasted garlic and herb butter oh yeah you can watch it plump up then we have our black pepper and shot wow that's that's a little too much that was that's a little too much right there however the reason that we use the two to one ratio is so that we we really it's really hard to over season that way it's basically an insurance policy to make sure that you don't oversalt it get it nice and coated you want it to look like a lollipop that you dropped on your carpet this is going in the smoker at 275 for two hours and today we're smoking with pecan give it a little probe shall we know what temperature we need we're going to look for 165 internal and right now it's 50 54 and 53 degrees all right we're looking at 137 it's been in there for about an hour and a half looks pretty good I think what we'll do is we'll we'll wrap it to prevent any any over cooking all right we got our butter we got our we got our turkey we're gonna place it right there and we're gonna throw it back into the smoker just like this all right we lost a little bit of heat but uh I'll see you at 165. all right let's pull it I think it's time we we open it up and and take a look at all of our hard work today this is this is certainly a turkey that has shrunk it certainly looks juicy but uh is it here well we'll start at the end there that looks pretty juicy to me now let's cut it right in the center plenty of juices coming out of there I'd say the injectable marinade did its job pretty well give it a little taste here this is probably the best turkey I've ever had I I am being totally sincere our total cook time was two hours and 15 minutes so almost right on the money with that two hour gas glistening turkey that is this is amazing all right but we're not here to make smoked turkey we're here to make smoked turkey sausage foreign we wouldn't have these kind of problems all the time if it were just if the hole were bigger [Applause] we don't want to waste this juice or that juice spread the love around in there a little bit one little two little three little sausages four little five little you see the shine would be racist if we didn't change the words oh are turkey jokes in three two one let's gobble hey this one's a hard sausage to crank out well that's it that's that's all the sausage that can be compressed out of there here's the rest of our turkey compressed into a disc at the bottom of this thing that's like two cups of of of of sausage that didn't get to get in there I think what I'll do is I'll repurpose this for Thanksgiving Which special thanks to today's Mark box hello box artist this guy 12 steps for nachos I think it was more like 11 steps what a perfect box of low box art for the holidays so will it blow up it still stands oh not bad we got it out of the tube it disintegrated upon impact I'm gonna have to give that will it Blow three Mark ruffalos well the smoker's still plenty hot like maybe I should throw this back on there we'll throw this on the smoker for an hour and then finish it up with a nice pan sear I feel as though we may have taken several steps backwards here we go not really making that much noise but it's cooking well well all right let's open it up and see how we did looks good it looks flavorful although I bet it's gonna be pretty dry here we go well it's it's it is dry all the all the turkey goodness is is is is pretty dry in there very flavorful but also very dry maybe this works better as a cuttable sausage that looks good the flavor's super concentrated now so it's it's very peppery very smoky but not salty so that's a good thing this is the way to go right here with these small pieces flavor-wise it's a five out of five I I just really can't see how much of this you would eat in one sitting because of how dry it is I think it's a pretty interesting novelty sausage so I'm gonna have to give this sausage here a three out of five pop we're gonna make turkey salad with this we got our celery some onions and mayonnaise there no wasted food on my watch "
