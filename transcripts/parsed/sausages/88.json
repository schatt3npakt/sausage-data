"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess well charlie it's uh you know it's thanksgiving or close to that thereof today we're gonna be we're gonna be doing the full thanksgiving meal to really celebrate the the meaning of this holiday that's what it's all about bringing the whole family together to make some quality sausages here in your dojo your neck of the woods well i mean it's my house but like you're we're gonna try our best not to screw this one up folks charlie what turkey's basically poisoned when it's in its raw state it's leave it to hell alone case in point you see all that yeah what is that that's yucky turkey water i need to get this turkey out of here kind of scared me away from turkey though you make it sound like a bomb turkeys in the united states suffer from a high degree of diseases so basically this thing's riddled with salmonella do i need like a gas mask or anything with a fumes toxic no the fumes are perfectly okay in fact but stick your head in there oh wow yeah she smells real fresh it's been thawing for three days in my backyard sweating up it's a million degrees in this house charlie he's trying to cook the boot and that's the turkey gravy hold on let's shove our hands right in you got to get right in there charlie we got screwed on the giblets instead they replace it with this gravy i don't know anything about coke hold on it's still frozen in there feeling like a heartbeat what's going on down there i think we found a giblet now you want to get in here with your big meaty paws you probably rip that out and crush it in the palm of your hand all right show me what am i trying to get here oh yeah it's pregnant look at that oh yeah good giblet uh you're starting a lawnmower come on baby rip road the turkey king is the one who can pull the giblet out here i'll hold the turkey down you get in there okay really pull spread its legs for me it keeps like closing in and like kegeling on me there it is wow that was a lot bigger than it is normal giblet size that's uh that's king-sized uh giblet oh charlie's mom it's good to see you again what the heck is this thing now oh wow oh oh wow what is this is that supposed to say in the turkey this no all right so i'm thinking a little salt a little pepper yeah of course how do you use time do i just like put the leaves on i'm assuming we're just gonna shove just just shove stuff into this bird i think that's the way they do it on tv as well i think it's pretty good technique actually i can see you drooling over there man it's delicious i've been trying to avoid eating it you said i'd get salmonella oh yes you will now now we've got our onions and you got to keep just cramming stuff into this bird oh you know what now we don't have room for stuffing i always prefer lemon onion thyme and sage instead of stuffing anyway i think we already have pre-made gravy so yeah just yeah lock it back in there the s you should call up your friends at adam and eve and tell them a new line a new line for them just for the holidays do we want to keep the the plastic on here no you know that's a that's a keen eye you got there charlie that that's why this is a group effort have you cooked a turkey before no do you want me to turn the oven on is that where the show is oh are you sure not it doesn't mean is this something we eat or is this just going to be like an ornamental decoration you know when the occasion comes you'll know that'd be amazing if this is the one that gets me demonetized let's turkey yeah there we go all right charlie we did a fantastic job on that turkey now we're missing the green bean casserole now this is one of my favorites so i hope we don't screw this one up that's impossible i'm gonna need you to open up four of these cans okay drain them and then dump them in the pan yeah in this all right fourth can of green bean initiated oh we got a little aluminum in there oh that feels nice you know this this this takes me back to i think i have all the cream here let me share let me share some of my cream with you oh here we go how's that that's big let's get in there now this looks like an oven that's never been used that's potatoes microwave instructions plastic lid and packaging and these instructions are the same so we won't be tearing the entire thing off this no you might as well keep it consistent yeah i agree charlie use your rat fingers to tear that off oh god wow charlie this this smells like a hospital this this is the mashed potatoes and i got to tell you they do not look mashed to me they look granulated oh my gosh i guess that's why you gotta cook it yeah i guess the heat does something to it that's the sound of flavor and charlie i say we go for uh we go for broke and we pour it all in let's get it i'm ready so do you want to start with the mashed potatoes let's start with the mashed potatoes and gravy okay we'll cross beans oh we don't want to forget the grave we gotta loop this up oh yeah absolutely thank you matt oh there we go yeah they tell you not to use your hands but i really don't see any other way i mean at some point you you you gotta you gotta grab life by the horns this is a fine looking sausage i think we're gonna get out of this well you know i think we could use some cranberry sauce with this oh wow that's what the bag's for i see she's scooping it this is really how the sausage is how you bring thanksgiving to your family's house [Applause] i mean this is gonna need two passes i mean look at that i mean it's gonna need it look at that oh yes it's it's turning back into ocean spray uh juice it's it it's starting to smell like thanksgiving don't be afraid of it get your hands right on it this is one of the heaviest sausages that that we've ever had on the show and who could forget green bean casserole the the onions not only provide a little bit of crunch needed crunch and two to our mix here uh but just flavor in general oh i agree one more scoop for luck it's appearing to me that we're running out of room so here let me let me do a quick oh there we go it's so hot to the touch it's getting there actually it's time for the main event yep just the classic american holiday i think we're we're setting a new tone for thanksgiving but if we turn it on let's suck it in no all right it's it's time for plan b oh the relief can i get you in the face there the dark meat that's the that's the leg this is a beautiful breast yeah it's so good i thought it was paper towel yeah really plunge it in there oh there we go oh whoa whoa she's really firing that's the white meat in three two one let chashed [Music] oh my lord that is something that you would go to the doctor for right there you need help yes i do yeah this is gonna this is gonna be a multiple man job here our arms aren't this long oh i think we're paul no problem the doctor is in we can just add more casing there's literally more than half still left of this at least half yet like how you can just see where the cranberry started and where it ended i thought maybe you want to put the casing on oh no no no no no no no no no no no no let's just change oh this is a much thinner one oh there it is i don't know what to do we're doing we're doing good you're doing good just keep it going we hit bottom oh my lord we we get it we're entering in a sausage territory that i

sausage interference on that one well the good news is i uh it's it's brown yeah oh no no no we're gonna eat this are you kidding me you're gonna eat this yes you know like when you're a kid and you
