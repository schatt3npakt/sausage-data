"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess i've been on a roll lately predicting which sausages will will be good and which ones won't be i'm predicting at least a four out of five on well that's just the worst possible way to open this up awful packaging look at this what a completely garbage packaging they're not so much sour patch kids as they are shower patch lumps these are sour patch lost souls will it jam just a couple we don't we don't need to go all crazy [Applause] ah it's it's not so much jamming as it is uh not doing much of anything oh that show that's that was clearly a bad idea that looks awful like ghostbusters ectoplasm i don't think there's any conceivable way to clean this up hold on i i gotta wash it off all right we're we're off to just just an awful start today we're gonna we're gonna fix all that because this is gonna be the sausage that turns out to be the best first things first let's let's clear this off whoops look at all that fat oh god there's a hair on it even on its own this would be a tasty sausage i'm no expert on the stock market but i'd be putting all my money in on pork belly i can still hear it struggling and there you have it that one uh a whole lot better than just putting them in shallow cut these up manually and toss them in it's probably not the best way to go about doing that so we're just gonna throw them in hole i backed my car into a sausage the other day well he just drove off sometimes life's okay in three two one let's just change ah that's a little bit of a hang up there let's try that one more time like a lot girthier than i uh uh wanted the odds of this thing bursting have increased sevenfold the the mark box hello art is coming in however i failed to realize that my printer doesn't print in color so we're i'm going to have to buy a color printer this will it blow is brought to you by hellofresh sweet child of mine it's almost springtime and that means you've already given up on all your new year's resolutions well get back on your high horse and start eating delicious nutritious and healthy meals with hellofresh have you been to the grocery store lately there are no savings to be had there but there are plenty of savings with hellofresh with their step-by-step recipes and pre-portioned ingredients you'll be eating good while saving dough and hellofresh has 50 weekly menu options to choose from so you know you're always gonna get something good or you can treat yourself and upgrade to the premium picks featuring a changing collection of top of the line recipes hello fresh recipes feature produce that goes from the farm to your front door in under a week which means their spring menu features this season's freshest flavors and quite simply it gives me peace of mind knowing at the end of the day i got a restaurant quality meal waiting for me instead of panic eating children cereal for dinner go to hellofresh.com and use code sausage16 for up to 16 free meals and three surprise gifts that's hellofresh.com code sausage16 for up to 16 free meals and three surprise gifts i we a little splatter a little a little something there i'm gonna have to give that will it blow two mark ruffalo's here we go oh oh no oh just hang on a little bit longer i wonder if the acid in the shower mix is what caused that that casing to burst this time well here's hoping that it's cooked enough why don't why don't we grab a couple of beers and open this up and see how we did just so so much of it has has burst already likely if your sausage showed up like this at a restaurant you you wouldn't you wouldn't be too pleased all right let's uh that's a little bit easier to swallow okay i guess uh here we go um i'm not totally convinced that that's all the way cooked it it it it it it tastes like like like a sour it tastes like sour patch it's not a pleasant taste that you want mixed in there with your pork gummy skin uncertain whether or not it's completely cooked normally i'd give it you know like a one out of five for for the effort at least but uh you know this thing this thing was just such a disaster look wise taste wise texture wise there's no other score to give this but a 0 out of 5. and we'll all float on a sausage i'm ready we'll all float on again all right that's not going anywhere "
