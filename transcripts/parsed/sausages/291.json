"well hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess and today we're doing what we're doing that we're doing kangaroo meat marley roo where's this even from ah australia do i have any reservations about eating kangaroo no to me they're just giant rats that hop around you wouldn't need a rat you don't know me let's get a close-up of this mrs sausage i'm very excited about this i've never actually had kangaroo before it looks like normal meat all right what an um what an unveiling this was looks can be deceiving because this thing it smells livery livery it smells like a liver let's cook up a little piece of it and give it a try before we turn it into sausage and yeah we're gonna hit it with a lot of salt and even more pepper that's probably way too much salt all right now we're now we're slightly cooking shouldn't we have an event i mean you should we're not selling this meat so it's perfectly okay to be cooking and eating meat that's made in your basement for your health well papa's got sausages to make have you seen her i'm not going to make all this into sausage we'll do like one or two loins and and and maybe save it depending on how good this steak turns out tell me have you seen it it's the venison of the bush it's the buffalo of the of the uh ocean what is this 300 it's way too hot this seems like too much oil in too much heat but here we go is it a fatty cut no this is a very lean meat which brings me to my next point good sausage is fatty i didn't have any fat so i went out and bought this salt pork i don't know if you're supposed to use this for sausaging or not but it looks like it's got plenty of fat on it so we're going to mix the kangaroo in with this salt pork and hope for the best did this thing stop cooking starting to burn you know who you don't see a lot of these days rob zombie we probably could have used a little bit of olive oil and a little bit of butter ooh and a sprig of rosemary i'm not going back upstairs no we don't have any of that we're going to try to find a spot for this where it hasn't been contaminated with raw kangaroo meat here we go there it is a perfect raw however the end piece has got to be done that's like a medium it's on your oh well that's what it's for it's a lot gamier than than than normal beef on the on the rare end it kind of tastes like filet mignon well that was a good treat however we're not here to make kangaroo steaks like some sort of chunk we're here to make kangaroo sausage with salt pork we got our kangaroo meat let's begin you know the drill we're gonna chop up this meat mix it in with pork and and then turn it into a sausage just look at how rare that is it's almost blue it looks like tuna nothing cuts meat better than a chinese vegetable cleaver let's get this pork skin off of there that's kind of you kind of don't want to eat the skin and we'll stick it in the freezer for 30 minutes we got our almost frozen meat here salt pepper garlic powder onion powder just a hint of of of cayenne pepper [Applause] it's regrowing time [Music] that looks pretty good i i i almost wish we had a little bit more fat in there to be honest with you when you're stuffing the sausage stuffer you become the sausage stuffer here we go you don't you don't want to rush these things there is a small chance of the casing tearing on the sausage tube looks like we have a pretty good sausage on our hands in

we go we got a barn burner here uncomfortable declaring this uh done let's open it up and see how we did well as far as sausages go it it looks done that piece looks a little too tiny for me we put the baby in the bonnet kangaroo sausage here we go i guess we should have held back on some of that salt because we were using salt pork after all well you you certainly know you're not eating pork or beef with that sausage it almost almost tastes like jack links beef jerky but it's also flavorful without being too pushy i don't know perhaps we shouldn't use the salt pork perhaps we shouldn't have reground it i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a three and a half out of five did you grow up seeing that or did you grow did you grow up growing in a garbage can no i've lived a privileged life
