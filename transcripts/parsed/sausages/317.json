"oh hey there folks and uh welcome back i guess who hasn't said to themselves that they would like to eat hot wasabi in shosh education of course this isn't real wasabi it's horseradish and and food coloring but uh you know it's it's the best we can do under these circumstances this is the same wasabi you get when you get your your your supermarket sushi there well all right let's get to it we got sausages to ruin we'll start with uh uh and all wasabi sausage take a bite of that squeeze well as we say on this show that's as good as that's gonna get trust me i i don't want to eat any more of this than i have to a nice little baby poop sausage there looks good looks like a ton of sausage meat look at that natural color it's a clinger all right and just because i thought that wouldn't be enough i i got some extra from the uh from the guy there oh look it's imprinted into the wasabi more it's like it's like it feels like play-doh that's got to be more than enough i i think just a smidge more that'll do it and we'll hit it with just a little bit of soy sauce for that salt flavor now we're making sausages the right way you gotta just get in there with your hands all right that looks good enough cause i'm free free shawshank whoops whoops in three two one let's josh oh you gotta be kidding me all right well we we were almost at the end anyway you know you're in for a bad time when the sausage bursts before you even get a chance to put it in the pan you're weak you've always been weak and there's special things to today's mark boxalo artists like there's different zones there's the two out of five the three the four off the boxes of one oh the whole thing is written out right here so well you know will it blow oh like we got a triple actually we got some in the four areas we almost get up we should give that will it blow four mark ruffalos we're all right here we go i'm gonna take this guy out that's cooked enough we'll call that time well okay let's open it up and see how we did that's a little too that's a little too small we'll just trim the other edge off wow that was a swing and a mess it appears to be uh normal you there's uh hardly any trace of green in there let's give this guy a little bite see okay so that's entirely way too spicy my my mouth went numb because of the spice so that's a zero like let's see if we can do any better uh there's a tinge of green to it here we go this one's pretty hot too it burns in the nasal cavity the skin you know despite our best efforts didn't really crisp up it uh it's it's kind of kind of loose in there it has a wasabi aftertaste to it but otherwise it's it's a pretty plain tasting sausage you know we didn't put any salt in there because you know i thought the whole thing would just taste like wasabi uh and it doesn't it tastes mostly like unseasoned pork so all in all i'm not i'm not very impressed by it i'm gonna have to give this sausage here a 2 out of 5. your eyes "
