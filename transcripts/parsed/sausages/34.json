"well hey there folks and welcome back I guess and boy is that is yeah we're doing this I guess we're going to be doing this I just realized that the fish that I purchased is way too big for the grinder here's the grinder and there's the fish and you know as we can see by the laws of physics you know which isn't going to happen I shall we got to find out another way to to get this guy in there take me to the river drop me in the water why yes that night give just likes my finger and do you know luckily luckily for us had the only band-aids we have in the house of these these frozen two band-aids this time it's personal well that was an ordeal you know it also says to not put you know the bones in the grinder it's more it's more of a challenge than it is you know an actual warning [Music] [Music] yeah we host it all right so uh no bones no bones in your meat grinders people [Music] this has been just a very scarring experience overall I don't feel any of the bones so you know I don't think we need to do another pass through so that's fantastic news and I think it just disintegrated it smells like if a if a fish came into my home and just left a fresh one right on the living room floor this is like the smoothest this is like the Cadillac of putting one of these things on here see this thing it pushes it down I mean that way we get the Gator out of it first that way it doesn't go into the sausage all right in 3 2 1 let sausage you know one of these days that's gonna that's gonna sound real nice here we go well there you go that's that's one whole snapper look at that there's no flat bottom on this pin so we're just gonna have to use this imported bean sprouts and water to kind of kind of make it level here all right in there 3 2 1 let's so it's sausage again we have the keys I think they're just too small that's not gonna do anything for you then this is just slightly too tall for it you're gonna tip it too much the other way and so the bean sprouts they just slide from right under and there we go we'll see how we did that's about what I was expecting I think we're in for a wonderful a wonderful gastronomic experience okay so I have to be careful because there are bones in this so the first point will be a very delicate bite so it tastes wise it's really not that bad it's a good day it was a good snapper so nothing wrong really with the taste yeah you know it tastes like it tastes like a fish it could have used a little bit more help maybe some pepper or maybe some garlic I don't know you know what the world's your oyster those small bones are definitely coming back to bite us because they are in there if you were to order this you know at a restaurant that's immediately you send back so in that sense it's a zero out of five however fish sausage is a real thing so you know this is easily going to be a five out of five if we just look up a recipe you know and don't you know throw the entire fish into the grinder if we were to ignore the bones taste-wise this would be like a three out of five so for what we did today because there's bones in there but not flavor-wise it's getting a zero out of five pop-pop-pop-pop written "
