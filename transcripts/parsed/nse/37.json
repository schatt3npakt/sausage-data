"all right look boiling the steaks and stuff just doesn't transfer the taste like it should so we're gonna try sous vide this time we're gonna use our partially freezer burned filet mignon and give it that maple maple syrup taste now that's a food saver that's now clogged with syrup it's syrupy we're gonna be doing this at 1 34 today for two hours make me proud and that's two hours and there it is how about we share it and see how it is what a terrible share job oh well we're not here for this year we're here for the flavor well we got a pretty good looking medium there let's uh give it a bite when you use a sous-vide you're going to get a perfectly cooked steak every time I mean it's good it's it's really good it's a really good steak and it just kind of sort of tastes like maple syrup I I was expecting that maple syrup to deeply penetrate the steak it's a good steak it just reminds me of banquet breakfast sausage links I'm gonna duck at one point because that maple syrup didn't deliver maple syrup magic maybe if we used real maple syrup that would have made a difference and not high fructose corn syrup so I'm gonna have to give this steak here a four out of five "
