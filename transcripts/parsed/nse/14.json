"you know when i first started doing these nscs i never realized that google was also doing something similar this guy's done it all i was gonna boil a steak and butter too but he beat me by three weeks so i checked out his channel suvi everything and i realized that there's there's one thing that that he hasn't souved yet so we're going to sue this big mac but not only that we're also going to sue this steak covered in a different big mac of course my suv machine isn't nearly as cool as his [Music] well all right now now this thing's gonna last forever we're not done yet put some there in half there well it just looks like ground beef our steaks are you know about two inches uh thick and then we're gonna then we're gonna cover it with uh with our with our seasoning our homemade seasoning here and you don't wanna forget you gotta do both sides that's gonna be good enough throw it right on in well i guess we didn't need that uh a whole big bag for this but we got this thing we got this thing locked in then we're gonna bump this up to 135 and we're gonna cook them for two hours that's for you and then this guy's also for you have fun in the water boys well all right folks i'll see you in two hours all right then that's two hours this thing looks just as up this looks just as good as when it went in and how about you big mac you're looking you're looking pretty tasty too well all right first things first let's see how the big mac did it uh it it it i mean it's it's still it's not it's it's it's it doesn't look nearly as as good as it used to well there it is all right let's let's give this big mac a try now i'm not just saying this because i spent the entire afternoon making it but this is a superior big mac the the bread itself is actually not moist it it's it's still very much bready the inside is it's so tender this is a huge improvement for the big mac this is getting a five out of five got the main event here there it is it's still entirely covered in big mac that's what you want to see it is kind of coming off pat this down so that we can sear it a little flip we seared the big mac on top of our steak that's what that burn is that's not the actual steak that's just a good layer of big mac not quite medium rare we we we we we we we went over but we're not here to see how it looks we're here to see how it tastes if you're looking for a steak that tastes like a big mac look no further it's pretty gosh darn incredible it it it tastes like the thousand island dressing it it tastes it tastes like the pickles maybe you know you don't need the whole big mac maybe you just need those two ingredients probably the best steak i've made in a very long time i have no choice but to give the steak big mac and the regular big mac a 5 out of 5. now the only problem with this is i'm in his territory if google starts making weird sausages i'm i'm screwed "
