"we've made a slim gem sausage I think it's about time we make a slim Jem Burger how the heck do you open this thing there's 26 of these bad boys we got to open up there it is now the only question that we have to answer is will it hold into a Patty I'm thinking it won't what if we bind it with an egg what perhaps a bowl would have been better you know what that was a good idea here we go it hasn't been cooking too long but I I smell burning oh my God I think it's lacking in fat there we go both sides equally burned but it's nothing that we can't cover up with a little bit of ketchup and mustard here we go in terms of a great burger this is let's see if a slice of American cheese can save this Cowboy all right attempt number two yeah that really didn't help that much the problem is there's not enough fat in these slim gems there're it's it's too dry it's too crumbly and it loses that authentic slim gem taste when you heat it up as it stands now it's just slightly wetter than sawdust so I'm going to have to give the slim jim Burger a one out of five "
