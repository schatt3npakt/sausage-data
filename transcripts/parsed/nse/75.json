"this time it's celery you know I I really have no idea why these videos are so popular but the gravy train must keep on a rolling all right you know the drill 15 minute celery 30 minute celery 1 hour celery I may have forgotten to dry the pot off before I put oil in it well mistakes were made but uh here we go this may be the first one that we don't get to an hour 15 minute celery is almost it looks like beef jerky it tastes completely burned already 30 minute celery I got to be honest the 30 minute celery looks a lot like the 15minute celery Barky bark in the Funky Bunch it stopped frying like 15 minutes ago but uh this we made it to an hour now to taste the fruit of our labor vegan beef jerky there's no organic material left in there it just turns to Ash in my mouth so no winners in the game of deep fried celery they're all awful in their own unique way so I'm going to have to give the deep fried celery a zero out of five "
