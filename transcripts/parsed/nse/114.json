"we had such tremendous success with thick water lobster tail I think it's time we try it out on some thick water steak a little bit of Sal oh salt pepper and a little bit of garlic powder what are you doing did you getat all the Pringles here we go that sunk right to the bottom it's um it's it's it looks it it looks pretty it looks it's um I'm going to say it's done all right let's see God it looks disgusting let's um let's cut it open see if it's even done yet yeah we got a pretty good rare going there I think all of our seasoning belongs to the thick water now okay here we go it is completely flavor I mean it tastes like boiled beef and water we did it a disservice it's pretty gross the texture is all wrong not a fan I'm going to have to give the thick water steak a zero Z out of five "
