"what good is an espresso machine if it can only make espresso we're gonna we're gonna try to see if we can make a fast cup of instant soup with it i'm pretty sure i can skip this measuring part we're gonna go at it whole hog here oh there i see i see there's plenty more room for some more oh you don't want it to be too watery that looks good that looks like it's gonna make a pretty delicious cup of soup [Music] it it looks it looks it looks diluted well there it is there's our there's our creamy chicken soup let's let's check out the goods it looks it looks gross and the the taste is is very watery it's water with a hint of soup and that would probably be the reason why let's try it again oh there it goes it looks richer this time we'll we'll try a taste test still just as watery as the first time it may not be all be bad news uh it's all bad news espresso chicken soup that's a zero out of five "
