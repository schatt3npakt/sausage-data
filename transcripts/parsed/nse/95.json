"how does the mild tender flavor of a fet B Young compare with the horrible Taste of a malort first We'll add a little bit of salt an even smaller amount of pepper that's the whole kitten Kaboodle I need to see a list of positives and negatives of boiling liquor with an open flame here we go it smells like earthworms and feet it smells like a frog tank and nickels it smells like burnt plastic and cinnamon is it safe to breathe I don't know it's stronger Put The Knife Down it smells like rotten fruit and toenail clippings most of the alcohol actually burned away all right this thing I'm declaring is done all right we're hoping for a medium rare and that's what we got here we go hey it's so bad it tastes like cat ear medicine it tastes like sidewalk chalk and hamster beding uh really I can't think of a single good thing to say about this steak so I'm going to have to give the malort boiled and steak a zero out of five "
