"welcome back sausage fans I guess as you may or may not remember I tried to cook a shrimp with a 6vt battery and that didn&amp;#39;t end too well we melted the terminal many recommendations in the comment section told me to up the voltage but Mrs sausage said she didn&amp;#39;t want to raise these kids alone so instead of doing that I bought the hot dogger on eBay this puppy from 1966 produces 120 volts way more than this 6V battery so we&amp;#39;re going to test it out see if it still works and if it does we&amp;#39;re going to cook ourselves some shrimp and like always we&amp;#39;re going to be using Vienna beef hot dogs stick it on one end stick it on the other repeat the process for the rest of these now theoretically it should cook these in just 60 seconds things are starting to heat up wo things are getting foggy in there a common problem with the hot dooger is that a it ends up splitting the hot dog and it breaks the circuit oh that&amp;#39;s a burst and that&amp;#39;s another burst and that&amp;#39;s right on the 60c mark let&amp;#39;s open it up see how we did oh my God they they they are hot they feel like they&amp;#39;ve been microwaved for an hour this one doesn&amp;#39;t look too bad never mind and there&amp;#39;s a lot of deformation in this hot dog but how does it taste delicious of course we&amp;#39;re going to solve the splitting problem by using a shrimp here we have a nice prawn which will fulfill our needs as a shrimp today there oh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a little too short we&amp;#39;ll see if that works we&amp;#39;ll try one with the head just entirely on see if that works I&amp;#39;m so sorry this is what your body&amp;#39;s being used for and lastly we&amp;#39;ll do one that&amp;#39;s been completely deshelled all right here we go you know when it fogs up so much you can&amp;#39;t see anything that&amp;#39;s how you know it&amp;#39;s working I do see a color change happening all right it&amp;#39;s been a minute good Lord look what we got here here oh they shrunk up and they they they they detached from the nodes so it it it mostly got cooked before it got shriveled up I think this end will serve just fine delicious this guy with the shell still on he looks like he&amp;#39;s mostly cooked also good oh well all right there we go it looks beautifully cooked it&amp;#39;s a bit overdone can&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m too big of a fan of the hot dog and shrimp water so if you&amp;#39;re going to electrocute your shrimp I suggest you do it completely shell and if you have other suggestions of things that should be cooked in the hot doger let me know in the comments so to answer the question can you cook a shrimp with 120 volts yes "
