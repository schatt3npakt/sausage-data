"i have this leftover mcdouble here and uh i i i figured that you we should we should deep fry it better than tossing it in the old microwave get some flour going and a couple of eggs to make sure that the flour sticks now's the time to dunk the the mcdouble in the egg let's see if that's enough switch that looks good nice and coated we do have just a ton of oil left over from when we tried to deep fry bread ah that's yeah that's probably hot enough it looks like a disaster already i think it's starting to burn all right there it is it's it's certainly crispy that's that's what i can say about it so far let's see you know what it looks like on the inside it it it looks mildly tasty it's actually pretty good it still very much tastes like a mcdouble it's just got a little bit of extra crunch on the outside of it for today i feel confident giving this mcdouble a 4 out of 5.
