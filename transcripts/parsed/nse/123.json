"we&amp;#39;re back in deep frying better than ever 15minute avocado 30 minute avocado 1 hour Avocado now normally I don&amp;#39;t like hot avocado but uh I got a good feeling about this one I think we&amp;#39;re in deep frying range so far nothing much all right there they go that oil line got to the top pretty quickly oh my God I think it&amp;#39;s going over the the the rim oh it&amp;#39;s going over oh my God we&amp;#39;re going to give that some time D to simmer down now this guy burst so that&amp;#39;ll be our 15minute avocado let&amp;#39;s open up our hot Vado oh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s mushy H not bad so far now for a taste the light refreshing Taste of the avocado is gone and it&amp;#39;s been replaced by tastes like plain mashed potatoes always a good sign when the oil turns black you&amp;#39;re going to be our 30 minute avocado look at that I cut right through the seed the oil looks like it&amp;#39;s starting to eat its way on the inside as for the taste even more mashed potatoey than before this tastes like mashed potatoes with butter on it and 1 hour avocado and it&amp;#39;s not completely burned on the inside hey how about a piece of good news finally as for the taste this is the best tasting one of them all it tastes like butter and mushrooms so I can&amp;#39;t remember the last time that the one that was deep fried for an hour actually ended up winning so I&amp;#39;m going to have to give the deep fried avocado for an hour a three out of five "
