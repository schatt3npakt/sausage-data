"I saw this at the grocery store and I was like what tastes just a little bit better if it was waffled you're gonna waffle look just fine all right this better be the best 3.99 sweet and sour chicken I've ever had hold on it actually yeah it's pretty good 480 calories for this much just gonna push that all the way up then again you just kind of oh oh that's it's it's ready to roll all right here we go ah with this much white smoke coming out of the machine I gotta figure it's burning let's take a little look see under the hood all right looks somewhat good let's uh dig it out of there I guess it feels a little on the gummy side well it didn't it did not come out the way I expected it it broke apart I blame the vegetables myself here we go not bad hey hang on I got an idea Panda Express better call me after this one here we go again man and incredible it's an incredible chicken sandwich sort of this on its own is like a two out of five right out of the waffle maker it's like a three and a half out of five and this bad boy is like a four out of five I highly recommend it so I'm gonna have to give the waffle sweet and sour chicken a four out of five "
