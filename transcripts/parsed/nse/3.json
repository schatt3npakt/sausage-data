"i i think we can all agree that hard-boiled eggs are delicious but would they be better if if they were boiled in jell-o that's what we're gonna find out today oh that that was almost a boil over ever ever so gently you know what you don't want to crack those eggs look at look at that look at that jello boil that's probably that's probably enough good that's probably good enough now we now we set this in the fridge for you know like i guess a few hours to get this to to cool down these eggs are steaming let's let's take a look at that the eggs here they seem to be uh red it looks completely the same as if you you de la as if it wasn't boiled in jello at all that's the sound of a winner this one shows more signs of being under duress let's take a bite and see how it is it tastes like a normal hard-boiled egg let's go ahead and mark this experiment down as yet another failure "
