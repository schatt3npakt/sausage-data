"it's been a while since we used the dehydrator so we're gonna do a quarter pounder and french fries this time I got the large fries and not to be outdone is the quarter pounder and look at that it looks like someone took a bite out of it already and uh yeah in fact I I am now certain more than ever that someone took a bite out of this before they gave it to me you know never look at your McDonald's burger that's there's never good times are gonna happen if you do that and we can't forget about the star of the show right in the center I mean seriously if you received a quarter pounder like that would you would you eat it still all right well we'll check on this in a little bit see how it's doing three hours in six hours 20 hours all right that's 25 hours and it doesn't look like much has changed so we'll we'll let it run for another 24 hours and that's 48 Hours it it looks the same it looks like they it hasn't been dehydrated at all but they have been dehydrated card look at that it's flaking off oh goodness gracious let's go ahead and give it a bite it's like a burger cracker it's like eating a cracker with beef jerky on it that also happens to taste like McDonald's now let's try these french fries they taste like Potato Sticks that you get at the grocery store those are not bad as well I mean the texture is hard but but the flavor's there call me crazy but I like it so I'm gonna have to give the dehydrated Quarter Pounder and french fries up four out of five "
