"once a treat you only got at your grandma's house is now going to be the flavoring for our steak oh they're covered in plastic that Pott's too big I'm going to be here all day if I knew this was going to take all day I would have brought a piss pot salt fresh Cracked Pepper it looks like strawberry nesquick wow wow Mama I'm scared what in the what what color is this here we go what's going on here hey guys what the heck ah see when the color turns brown you know the steak is done and there we are oh what a sear we already have I poured it down the sink and it turned into a butthole the the steak is kind of cemented to the board there we go if I didn't know what this was I would I wouldn't even try it let's give it the old College try here and we overcook the heck out of it here we go um there there's absolutely no Peppermint taste at all and the steak is hard as a rock I don't recommend this one the steak's tough and chewy and doesn't taste like much of anything so I'm going to have to give the oldfashioned peppermint candy steak a one out of five I'd be remiss if I didn't try some of our steak brittle tastes like burnt peppermint and something else that's a zero out of five "
