"all right we're batting 500 with these baking steaks inside of other things but I got a feeling this one's gonna be a winner of course the first decision you have to make is which which way you gonna cut it like a hot dog or like a hamburger I'm feeling pretty good about the hot dog style of cooking a steak inside of a pineapple I may have bitten off a little bit more than I can can chew now that's a pineapple hole you can be proud of some salt and fancy black pepper shove our probe right into the steak make sure that we get the correct temperature and then we're gonna nail it shut with these wooden scares they never tell you how important wire cutters are to making a good steak all right current steak temperature is 50 degrees we're gonna pull it out at 132. I can tell this one's gonna be good all right after 30 minutes we're only at 62 degrees so so I bumped it to another 30 minutes and we'll check it again after that then ended up taking two hours oh we forgot one looks pretty good in there then we'll hit it with a little sheer let's let's see how we did medium rare here we go it's bad the snakes like turning into goo it's got this weird texture to it and it's absolutely flavorless it was soaked into the pineapple it's literally one of the worst tasting steaks that I that I think I've ever made zero out of five "
