"it's time we make some high quality Cuisine you may have heard of black garlic before but we're going to make super black garlic 15 minute garlic 30 minute garlic 1 hour garlic those garlic bulbs are cruising at around 360 they actually look really good it smells incredible in here well things have taken a turn for the worse 15minute garlic and uh for the most part it looks uh pretty okay the garlic is hot it kind of has the same consistency as mashed potatoes 30 minute garlic this one's a little bit easier to cut into oh it just falls apart mostly unscathed let's give it a try it's now even more liquid than mashed potatoes are and it tastes more garlicky like the garlic got more concentrated I so a slight Improvement that's 1 hour garlic and now the moment of truth can I I can't I can't cut this thing oh my God just why won't you cut jeez all all right it's just it's like it's just all shell it disintegrated I think I found one now that's black deep frying a bulb of garlic for an hour it'll leave you with literally nothing a 30 minute garlic although it tastes better you you do lose a lot of the actual garlic that's in there really your best bet is to do the 15minute garlic that'll yield you most garlic per garlic but really I don't see a culinary use for any of this so I'm going to have to give the deep fried garlic a one out of five "
