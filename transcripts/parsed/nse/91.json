"change of pace on this one because we're going to introduce meat 15minute hot dog 30 minute hot dog 1 hour hot dog I like this one because it's going to require the least amount of oil I go through so much oil well all right we're officially in deep fried range now we got a reaction going here once those hot dog juices hits the oil it's game on 15minute hot dog oh uh you know what it looks like it's got a crispy outside and a pretty juicy inside really good a really solid hot dog 15 minutes might be the perfect amount of time to deep fry your hot dog oh my God these are these are Smoky Boys 30 minute hot dog oh there's still some meat left inside it's now good it tastes mostly like burning with a hint of hot dog flesh 1 hour hot dog looks like a cat turd with blood in it oh there's no hot dog left it's all just ash there's nothing in there it tastes like cancer the 15-minute hot dog is absolutely amazing so this is a zero this is a zero as well I'm going to have to give the 15-minute hot dog a four out of five "
