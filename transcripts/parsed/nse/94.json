"today we're making pizza soup it doesn't look any better now I know what you're going to ask is pizza soup just a pizza boiled in water yes that's exactly what that is all right and then it's just a simple matter of just there we go what a lovely broth color we already have you know perhaps a bigger pot would have been the wiser choice to make I will say this it's it's starting to smell pretty good it's impossible to tell if it's done but we'll go with the assumption that it is it looks really rich and brothy it's actually surprisingly good I think I'm going to finish the bowl we only boiled this one for an hour if we if I'd say if we boiled it for another hour we'd have a less watery broth and a pretty rich broth not only is it pizza but it's a supreme pizza so you got onions you got Peppers you got saashi it tastes like a liquid Pizza I don't know I I I like I love it um so I'm going to have to give the pizza soup a four out of five "
