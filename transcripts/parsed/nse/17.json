"you better believe it spaghetti jello day it's jello time and spaghetti time this this reminds me of my trip to venice where they served me vermicelli boiled in pudding we're going to strain off the excess liquid we're just going to see if the if the spaghetti itself takes on jell-o properties that's looking like some angry spaghetti i think that maybe cherry was the wrong choice of flavoring i'm pretty sure this is how licorice is made yep under the tuscan sun then we're gonna ruin this container by putting the spaghetti right there put it in the fridge for a few hours what do you say and that's two hours it it it doesn't seem to be very jello-y let's get a boatload here here we go i made a joke earlier about this looking like licorice and i gotta say it tastes almost exactly like shoestring licorice this is this is incredible well of course it's sweet but it tastes almost like cake feels a lot a lot stronger than normal speaking oh no never mind uh but i i'm seriously impressed i i think that this this could only get one score possible and that score is a 5 out of 5.
