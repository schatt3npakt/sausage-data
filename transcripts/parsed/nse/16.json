"today we're making ice cream steak and give it a good ol squeeze oh oh god oh god oh god oh god oh we almost had a boil over so we're gonna go ahead and add our steak like just just ever ever it's okay we're riding the rim no no no no no go go go go oh my god i can see the steak all right our steak's been cooking for like for like 10 minutes let's let's get it out of there you're beautiful then we're good we're going to pat this dry and then we're going to sear it you know maybe at some point we should you know add seasoning to it we'll just add a little bit of salt let's let's cover it up with a little bit of ice cream sauce it's uh i it's a perfectly cooked medium here we go well of course i had you know the piece with you know the most amount of ice cream on it let's try a piece free of ice cream here we go it doesn't taste anything like ice cream just tastes like a perfectly cooked steak the ice cream sauce is actually pretty good on the one hand i feel it should get a five out of five because if if i would serve this at a restaurant i would order it again easily but at the same time it doesn't taste anything like the thing we boiled it in i'll i'll i'll dock it a point just because it doesn't taste anything like ice cream but it's still a very good steak so this ice cream steak is gonna get a 4 out of 5. how "
