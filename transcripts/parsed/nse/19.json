"we got eight hot dogs here that we're gonna try to turn into beef snack sticks in in a in a food dehydrator we got our machine here set it for what what temperature is there supposed to be seven 165 i probably should have loaded these hot dogs in there before you know pressing start we're gonna check on these at the two hour mark cut into it so far it just feels like a a warm hot dog we're like four hours into this thing and i feel like all i'm doing is keeping the hot dogs warm like they do at 7-eleven so all i'm gonna do is just chop that end off and that end off as well so that we can get more moisture sucked out of these things we're eight hours into this thing and these sausages look exactly the same they appear to be exactly the same as when they went in uh eight hours earlier we're gonna we're gonna cut into these two these eight hour old ones they look exactly the same they are a little bit darker and they are just a tad smaller than the than the than the two-hour old hot hot dogs a tiny reduction in size and and scale we're gonna have to let these run all night these are now gonna be dehydrated for 24 hours all right it's been 24 hours let's get two of them out and ah they feel they feel jerky like it looks like a beef stick looking good let's let's try it let's try a bite we're in jerky town my friend here's the the two hour old hot dogs these are the the six hour old hot dogs and these are the 24 hour hot dogs mrs sausage try one of these no all right i i don't know if it needs any more time i think it's it's pretty much beef jerky at this point it made no difference whatsoever if if the end was cut open or not not bad not a bad beef jerky this certainly doesn't save any time it may not even save you money but if you got some hot dogs that are about to expire throw them in your dehydrator and sure enough you're gonna end up with some nice beef snack sticks yeah that's hard it's ironic i'm gonna have to give the dehydrated hot dogs a 5 out of 5.
