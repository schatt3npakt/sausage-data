"should you cook a steak inside of an onion we're gonna we're we're gonna find out and some garlic powder just just to add some some layers to this then of course it's just a simple matter of shoving this inside of the onion that's good that's a solid fit and then we're gonna wrap it up with some twine to make sure that that steak's not going anywhere we're gonna Jam this probe and make sure that we're not done until this reaches an internal temperature of 134. it's currently at 54. this isn't gonna be like Ultra cabbage where we cut into just raw pork over and over again we're gonna try 425 for an hour and we'll see what uh what this has to say about it well that only took 30 minutes steak with a little Crown all right well let's share it in and then eat it looks more rare than medium rare if you ask me but I'm just going by the thermometer here we go we go there's certainly a hint of onion in there but you'd probably get more onion flavor just by using onion powder it is a filet mignon so it's super tender already but I think that onion really steamed the tenderness right into it flavor wise it just doesn't taste much like an onion texture wise it is it is it is super tender this is like the most tender steak I've ever had ah so I think it's worth your while to try just for the tenderness of it ah so I'm gonna have to give the the steak baked inside of an onion a five out of five "
