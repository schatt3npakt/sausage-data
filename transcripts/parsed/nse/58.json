"let's make a huge Starburst 50 yellow 53 orange 26 pink and 53 Reds need a couple more to round this out well all right let's do it I think it worked now that's a starburst so you can hang your hat on I think we got the dimensions almost right but of course the real question is how does it taste it's super chilly I've been chewing it for like two minutes I don't know how to score it it's just it's just a big it's just a big Starburst it may be just a little too chewy for some people so I'm gonna have to give this a four out of 5.
