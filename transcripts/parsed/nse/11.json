"today we're going to make real honey chicken by boiling chicken and honey give it the old squirt that that's taking a bit too long we don't we don't have that kind of time man that's heavy we'll do a little seasoning of of salt i've never really boiled chicken and honey before this is starting to look like the stuff from ghostbusters too so i'm just i'm gonna put this to bed now there's our chicken the honey keeps boiling over this looks pretty pretty gosh darn evil i changed at a steady 228 god this thing's plump that's a plumper let's get this out for a taste test already look at that beautiful piece of chicken all right let's let's see if it's even remotely done not even close maybe we'll try a a an end that's you know done there that looks like it won't kill me it just slightly tastes like honey what if we cube this chicken up into more bite-sized pieces now it's time to try out our our honey chicken bites all right well first things first is is it done all signs point to yes in bite form it it it works a lot better you can taste a lot more of the honey than when it's you know a fully intact chicken breast but should you buy an entire bottle of honey just to boil chicken in it you know that's that's probably not the best way to spend your money you're better off just covering your chicken and honey and and baking it theoretically yes you can boil your chicken in honey but should you now now "
