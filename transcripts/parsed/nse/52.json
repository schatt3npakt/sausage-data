"Bacon's good things that are wrapped in bacon is gooder so bacon wrapped bacon should be goodest if I could make an amendment to my initial statement cooked bacon is good uncooked bacon feels like you're playing with guts that's the thickest cut bacon now look even even I know that this is a dumb idea until it works and then and then it's a genius idea and then you just start wrapping it I guess make sure there's plenty of overlap you don't want any bacon showing through when you bake the bacon I think we're gonna have to use sticks I I really don't think anyone's prepared for the amount of grease that is going to come off of this thing it's gonna be greasy and we'll Ram this one right up the rear end just just to say that we got something accomplished today looks good looks stable let's throw this bad boy in the oven gently gently almost like I know what I'm doing I think we're about halfway done that's a lot of Grease well okay let's uh let's open it up see how we did oh this I forgot about the middle stick yeah it's cooked but not quite as crispy on the inside oh mama all right uh let's give it a try here it is superb absolutely fantastic you got the crunchy exterior you got the not so crunchy interior this is like the perfect low-carb sandwich but this is by far one of the most shocking things to ever occur on this show I'm gonna have to give the bacon wrapped bacon a five out of five pop "
