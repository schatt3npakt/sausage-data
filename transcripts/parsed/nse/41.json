"today we're going to make some oreo fried chicken and we'll just separate those creams right out no problem that's good enough oh it's a big piece of chicken perhaps the platon ball are a bit too small for our current objectives and kerplunk this is looking good this is this is what success looks like even even coats oh okay oh there's smoke starting to rise oh it's so black nah it's it's holding together a whole lot better than I ever expected it would it looks like a really good smoked brisket now we're gonna play everyone's favorite new game is it raw as you can see it's it's crusted all over let's start here look at that cookie outer shell here we go it's not bad the Oreo provides a nice cookie crunch there's that rawness you don't want to see in your chicken the the Oreo shell actually loses a lot of its sweetness due to the deep frying I mean we didn't season it with anything other than than Oreo it could have used some salt it could have used some pepper uh but who would have thought that Oreo shell is uh is is a suitable way to crust your chicken so I'm gonna have to give the the Oreo encrusted Fried Chicken uh three and a half out of five pop "
