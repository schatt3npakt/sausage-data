"all right here we go again this time we're using Tomatoes everyone's favorite fruit slash vegetable so we're deep frying them again this one for 15 minutes this one for 30 minutes and this one for the full hour gentlemen 's 55. let's let's go ahead and tell whoa It's skyrocketing 15 minute tomato 30 minute tomato whoa whoa whoa one hour tomatoes okay I don't think they're gonna last 15 minutes this guy's already lost his kids taking out this guy because he's pretty he's pretty badly damaged for our 15 minute tomato but how does it taste pretty good it tastes like a Hot Tomato so far but it's uh you know we'll see what happens with the 30 minute tomato 30 minutes all right this this one's slightly more singed and it's a lot more juicier on the inside looks pretty much the same however and The Taste they're getting more flavorful as time goes on this one's more tomatoey than the 15 minute tomato and that's one hour it is it is it is solid well that's that's almost completely carbonized but how does it taste it tastes like burnt so of the Three Tomatoes I would say that this middle one tastes the best uh this is a zero this one's a one and this one's a a three out of five "
