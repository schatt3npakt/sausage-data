"today we make history throw that away can smell the regret already it uh it looks it looks pink I'm I'm thinking I'm thinking it's done now I know what you're thinking hey that looks that looks that doesn't look very pink at all but it certainly tastes like Crystal Light Lemonade but I think we can double the amount of pink lemonade flavor you know we probably could have done the exact same thing with Pepto-Bismol there's that pink color we've been waiting for Here We Go it's a success it's just not very good it's so Tangy and sour maybe some of that mac and cheese powder can save us you think this is how they came up with the Flaming Hot Cheetos macaroni somewhat better it's it's like super it's super acidic and super Tangy and super tasting like lemonade not something that I would probably ever eat ever again so I'm gonna have to give the mac and pink lemonade uh zero out of five "
