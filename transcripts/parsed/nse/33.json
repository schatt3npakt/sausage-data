"today we're gonna make the ultimate Cheesesteak by boiling this steak in this cheese this feels wrong in in so many ways well cheese even boiled this might just burn oh yeah that's getting melty I don't think it's gonna get any more meltier than it is right now here we go [Music] oh that's a lot of cheese oil it's not quite covering this steak we got to give it a little help all right so we'll we'll see you in 10 minutes we're about halfway through the 10 minute cooking things are things are looking pretty oily the smell has changed from cheese to burnt hair well it's been 10 minutes and although I can't explain it it smells exactly like green bean casserole let's get this out of here and see if it's done good God that's wow wow you know perhaps I shouldn't get this out over an open flame damn it's stuck what are you stuck on there we go good God I left a nice little cheese hole in there we'll get this started with some of this steak and cheese oil all right uh here we go again I guess oh it how did I clip it on the wrong side then we'll just add a side of cheese for dipping it's gonna take me forever to clean this out let's you know see how we did huh it's pretty good we got a medium going here here we go oh man that is that is good that's real good try it with some cheese it's incredible it is a fantastic steak it's got a nice little cheese tanginess to it and dipping it in the cheese sauce really sends it over the edge here the steak tastes like cheese and the cheese tastes like steak we got we got a winner here remember the only seasoning on here is the cheese this is probably one of the best ideas I've ever had I have no choice but to give the Cheesesteak a five out of five pop "
