"it's time to Gogurt up this chicken why Mr Sausage why boil chicken and Gogurt if we don't boil chicken and blue Gogurt then who will now we need to balance out some of that blue with red you'll need 16 Go-Gurt tubes if you want to repeat this at home okay I think we we ready to boil this chicken here's one and here's the other one it smells like Tums I think the yogurt's starting to thicken back up all right I think it's ready for the next step they're stuck to the bottom it's going to take me a year to clean all this out salt pepper all right this one we lost most of this one in the great getting it out of uh the pot of 2024 this one however I think looks pretty good here we go it's actually very good the strawberry and cotton candy flavored Gogurt uh it it it made a sweet chicken but when is Sweet Chicken ever bad I think there's a future in this if anything we put a little too much salt and pepper on it I really like the sweetness of it so I'm going to have to give the Go-Gurt chicken a 4 and a half out of five "
