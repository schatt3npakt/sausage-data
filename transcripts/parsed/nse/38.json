"this Sushi looks like it's seen better days we are officially one day past the selling point on this sushi so we could eat it like it is now and and risk getting sick but I think I have a better idea for this expired sushi you can't forget the Pickled ginger here and a little bit of Wasabi on at least one of them there's a lot more smoke coming out of this thing that I ever could have imagined look at it go what that smell I broke the handle that's a spicy waffle the smell of that cooked tuna is is even worse than it was in raw form it smells like right before the inspector shut down the Chinese buffet bam let's give our Sushi waffle a bite I can't believe it it's actually extremely good and the little Waffle holes make a great spot to fill your soy sauce in let's try with the soy sauce you got the crispiness of the rice it's still a little soft in the middle that tuna tastes pretty good in there too every everything works about this the ginger the Wasabi if this was at a restaurant I would definitely order it like this Mr Sausage you want to try one today no I have no choice but to give the sushi waffle a five out of five "
