"last time we tried this with chocolate it didn't go so well but this time gross you don't you you don't want yeah you don't want that touching the steak this is the worst part is is the unwrapping you wouldn't think it takes a long time but you know it it does still going strong baby that doesn't look like enough well oh well I we're going to have to add some water oh slightly burned why isn't it ever easy I'm starting to be of the opinion that peanut butter does not melt our witch's brew is complete here we go I know you can sink to the bottom all right I think this bad boy is uh oh I think it's done taste our prize you couldn't ask for a better uh rare here we go beautifully cooked steak unfortunately it tastes like garbage I spit it out it's official now chocolate does not make good steaks when you boil it in the chocolate so I'm going to have to give this steak here a zero out of five "
