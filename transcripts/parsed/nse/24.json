"all right this one's actually a request from Mrs sausage he's a good half shower looking pickles here you know how this goes we load them all up and we'll pull them out at different intervals and see how they do well we'll try 115. that seems like a a reasonable number look at these pickles go actually I'm gonna pull one of these out right now because I want I want to compare them to the original pickle when we when we end this thing all right this is making my entire house smell like pickles so I moved this operation down into the basement here is our normal pickle here is our four hour pickle so we'll see you again at the eight hour mark they're getting they're getting shrively not that much difference between these two so far well all right here we have the the 24 hour pickle and there's still still some moisture in there I can feel so we're gonna let the remaining two run until they're completely dry and these two went for 48 hours because this was Mrs sausage's idea she gets to try the 48-hour pickle first oh it's like a rock you can't I break my dislike I break my all right well then I'm gonna try the pickle is it good no maybe you could ground it up into it a spice but [Music] that's a lot of pickle dust smells extra pickley now we try it so this tastes like a big pile of salt it it may look pretty but it tastes like salt with a little bit of cucumber in it and that's and that's it so I'm gonna have to give the dehydrated pickle at a half point a half a point pop "
