"we we've had some pretty good luck with our our noodle boiling experiments but uh i i say we got the annie with uh a little a little adult beverage here that that that that's too that's that's that's getting too much just skim the top there i i uh okay got it good enough way he cracked the noodles in half and now they're easier and more convenient to eat that's what you sound like we're boiling it in beard we're not curing cancer over here oh it's it's starting up again with the foam okay uh i think uh yeah i think those are pretty much done you can hear the carbonation in the noodles all right let's let's give these noodles a shot here [Music] oh well that's that's really bad it's uh it's very unlike uh it's it it it tastes uh uh rancid it's very bitter and and the aftertaste of the bitterness just increases after you you eat it maybe an ale would have been a better choice for this this one's getting a 0 out of 5.
