"you asked and I deliver today we're doing Lobster boiled in thick water moderately thick water it so thick it's like it's it it's like pouring motor oil I don't think this one Jug's enough to boil this lobster tail now that's plenty of thick water things are starting to happen in there I'm going to go ahead and say that that's boiling here we go you know perhaps we didn't need so much thick water there's too many bubbles oh that looks that looks bright and red and oh it's it's still so thick you know let's give it a try yep come on and then we'll just Ladle on a little bit of the lobster gravy oh it's so thick oh I split it beautifully cooked lobster tail here we go now don't get me wrong the lobster tail is perfectly cooked it's delicious it's tender however the the thick water slime that's attached to it is is pretty pretty pretty gross so in conclusion the thick water Cooks the lobster perfectly fine you will have to wash off any remaining residue because that's kind of yikes so I'm going to have to give the thick water lobster a four out of five I'm I know this is what you really want to see oh it's so thick "
