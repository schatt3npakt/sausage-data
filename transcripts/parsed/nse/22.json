"today we're gonna find out if you can turn an entire T-bone steak into beef jerky and we're gonna slather it with the greatest steak sauce known to man this is as thick as a hot dog so this will probably take like like 24 hours of of of of of of of cooking as well all right bon appetite fellas for like four hours into this thing and uh I'm gonna I'm gonna put more steak sauce on it it sure looks like it's cooking and dehydrating itself very well I forgot that it would that it would start leaking oil at it at 165 just a little more steak sauce just a little bit 12 hours it's uh it's hot it's drippy and that's 24 hours yeah looking like jerky kids it hasn't shrunk down that much has it it's like what 30 percent smaller looking it just come right out I still see a great deal of fat glistening in it I hope it's okay to eat like that I'm kind of nervous but let's see how we did it's good but I'm not sure how safe it is to eat so that's our T-Bone and uh you know Fat's not your friend when it comes to dehydrating food it kind of tastes like a cross between a very well done steak and beef jerky and that's it so I'm gonna have to give this T-Bone jerky here a three out of five "
