"real interesting concept for today we're going to use a rotisserie chicken to cook a filet manong there it is and you may be saying won't that ruin the chicken well of course it's going to ruin the chicken but we're here we're here to see what it does to the steak we're going to see if we can pass along that rotisserie flavor to the steak then it's a simple matter of just shoving the steak right inside of the chicken it's like it was meant to be when this reaches an internal temperature of 134Â° we're done I got a little distracted watching DuckTales we overshot the mark get get to the meat it looks it looks beautiful and it's a perfect medium it 100% tastes like a rotisserie chicken with the texture of a steak it's actually kind of grossing me out yeah it tastes exactly like a rotisserie chicken which I now realize is not a quality you want in a steak you want your steak to taste like a steak this idea was flawed from the start so I'm going to have to give this a two out of five "
