"today we're gonna figure out if you can deep fry bread first things first we gotta empty out an entire gallon of oil right on the heating element there yeah that's a whole lot of oil so then we set the temperature 379. and and climbing fast we'll try we'll try one rolex first and see how that goes oh it's it's a floater doug doesn't seem to be doing too much of anything kind of just looks like a a floating potato needs hotter oil i've come to the conclusion that this deep fryer sucks i'll take a look at what happened here and it looks the same let's try it again now that it's been breached this is a branded deep fryer that that doesn't actually deep fry anything that looks a little bit more promising it looks like a crouton it didn't penetrate very far hollow out the front there it's the cave of wonders we're just gonna stuff this thing full of cheese and a few slices of turkey and one more slice of cheese that looks pretty good we put the cap right back on that's packed in good after waiting for 30 minutes this thing just doesn't uh do its job ladle it in that's just taking way too long oh the bucket comes out it's too much oil now welcome back to now my least favorite episode of of ordinary sausage gotta figure out what i'm gonna do with all this oil we got this thing on the burner now oh okay this this is now well past 400 degrees and and and some would say skyrocketing even further make me proud that's the kind of of frying you want to see it's like a poop floating in the toilet the pot is 431 and this is 281 depends on where you hit the loaf i think it's starting to burn i'm i'm taking it out after three minutes well all right let's let's open it up and see how we did here it looks pretty good all right let's let's give this a shot the bread is is is very crunchy it's not bad you know maybe past 400 degrees is too hot do i recommend you doing this at home why not it's a fun little dangerous experiment that can cause fires we're gonna shove this whole thing in i realized too late that this is essentially how doughnuts are made that side's cooked now i have a complete understanding on why nobody deep fries bread turn this around on a plate that's way too small for it it looks burned the outside is completely burned the inside is completely untouched we're gonna mark this one as another nsc failure i i i better think of something good otherwise i'm back to boiling things in pickle juice i guess that worked it tastes like oil "
