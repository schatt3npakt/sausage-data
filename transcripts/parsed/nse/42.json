"don't you think it's about time someone made a Frank's Red Hot spaghetti our task today is to figure out whether or not there's any difference between boiling spaghetti and Frank's Red Hot Sauce or just dumping Frank's Red Hot Sauce on already cooked spaghetti that's that's not going to be enough French red hot sauce two pack will you bird shut up oh my God fight me Italians fun fact when the cat starts sneezing that's when you know that the Frank's Red Hot Sauce has reached the boiling temperature all right we're about halfway done put that bike back on all right it's been 20 minutes things are starting to smell Bernie we'll give it a texture taste test it's good it's Al Dente but right now it you know it just tastes like spaghetti smothered in Frank's Red Hot Sauce so we're gonna rinse this off and then we'll try it gotta spray the spaghetti from the bottom foreign on this side we have the Frank's Red Hot spaghetti on this side we have normal spaghetti covered in Frank's Red Hot Sauce it's super spicy but it tastes more vinegary than it does tastes like Frank's Red Hot Sauce I guess the vinegar is what got absorbed and now for the normal spaghetti covered in Frank's Red Hot Sauce I actually prefer the the spaghetti boiled in the Frank's Red Hot Sauce it's it's like it's like extra spaghetti I I you know I don't think I could eat more than you know a couple bites of it before I say well that that's enough of that but it's it's it's but it's definitely preferable to the one that's just been covered in this in the in the sauce I like it just just in small quantities so I'm gonna have to give the spaghetti boiled and Frank's Red Hot Sauce a three and a half out of five pop "
