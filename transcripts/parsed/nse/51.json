"I think we learned a lot about ourselves when we deep fried some apples for an hour let's try it again but this time with bananas all right so you know how it works we'll pull one at 15 minutes another one at 30 minutes and the last one at an hour things are starting to get bubbly okay okay now it's now it's really going that one's gonna be our 15 minute banana I really don't know if a banana can make in an hour so far all it's done is is turn the banana into a banana mush oh nothing Good's gonna come from this that is some black oil all right 30 minute banana it's your turn if there's anything left after an hour it will it will be a miracle I don't know what this means but the oil has stopped sizzling I think that means there's no more moisture left in this banana here we have the 15 minute banana here's the 30 minute banana this one's the hour boy there we go all right there's there's still some yellow color in there so now we're going to try them this one's good it tastes like banana mush but it's good now we'll try the 30 minute it's actually less mushy than this one it it firmed up a little bit and finally we'll do the our banana this one tastes like burnt sugar and the the best one is the 30 minute one yet again it has like the same texture as like artificial crab this one's like a two this one's a zero so I'm gonna have to give this 30 minute banana here a three out of five pop "
