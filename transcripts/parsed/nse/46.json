"I think it's time we finally deep fry some apples but this but there's more of a science experiment this one will be our 15 minute Apple this one will be our 30 minute apple and this one will be our our Apple oh yeah that's plenty hot we may have a slight problem if it may not get submerged enough okay that's a problem so that's a that's a bit of a whoopsie I thought the skin of the Apple was going to protect it now listen I don't remember which one's which so we're just gonna we're gonna call this one the 15 minute Apple we'll give this guy a little cut right down the center looks like a hot apple it's hot it's hot but it's but it's not really all that squishy still got some bite to it but let's give it a try it's not bad but I think 15 minutes is a little too early to pull out these fried apples well it's it's been 30 minutes and I gotta say I'm starting to get afraid of these apples oh that looks that looks sugary they're starting to get saggy that's a messed up looking Apple yeah we gotta do the Apple taste test here I kind of don't want to here we go it tastes like hot apple mush and what the heck is that thing well this thing won't stop smoking so so now is as good a time to take it out as any the entire house was filling up with smoke so I had to pull this out about five minutes early it's a crispy boy oh I don't want to eat that here we go it's got the same texture as a burnt marshmallow to me the best one is the one that was done for for only 15 minutes this was too much this was way too much if you're gonna do this I recommend doing it for 20 minutes or you could bake them like a normal person they're okay I'm gonna have to give these apples here a two and a half out of five "
