"forget lemon cake because we're making mustard cake all those substitutions are going to be replaced with mustard so a cup of water and half a cup of oil are all being replaced by mustard it's like after I get back from eating at Bob Evans why didn't I use an electric mixer this is so much harder all right I I think we're about ready here Halo Halo let me see your halo I can't tell if it's too thick or if it's not thick enough oh you know what this was the pans were supposed to be sprayed and in for 33 minutes all right they smell mustardy look at that and then we're going to finish this up with some frosting mustard mixture here we go looking good give it a little filling is it just my imagination or does this not look amazing and I don't have any sprinkles so we're going to have to use red pepper flakes and of course Miss sausage will be the official taste tester on this one no I won't all right and just like that we got mustard cake and now for the official taste test here we go the entire thing tastes like expired mayonnaise we were successful in the execution but not so much The Taste why didn't I use ketchup that would have made way more sense so I'm going to have to give the mustard cake a half a point "
