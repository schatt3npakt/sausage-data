"all right the Skittles was a bad idea but this has got to be a good idea burning more than it is melting so we're gonna add some milk to it add some more chocolate to this but first we'll hit this with some oh that's a lot of salt and also some pepper okay here we go get get in here we go you know it looks it looks pretty toxic and it doesn't smell like chocolate it smells like burning all right that was 10 minutes of pure unadulterated boiling ah let's finish it off with a sheer well okay let's open it up see how we did we got a medium rare going on here we go it's um it's confusing I'm not I'm not feeling the chocolate the steak is cooked well but that chocolate it's it's it's you know it's it's just not a good flavor combination it's two well chocolatey I guess it doesn't it doesn't work with a medium rare steak I guess that's why you don't see them on menus too often uh so I'm gonna have to give the steak boiled in chocolate a two and a half out of five pop "
